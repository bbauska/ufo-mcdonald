# Introduction 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._McDonald">James Edward McDonald</a> 
(7 May 1920 to 13 June 1971) was a Senior Physicist of Atmospheric
Physics and a Professor of Meteorology at the University of Arizona
(USA). He was also a pre-eminent American UFO researcher during the
1960s and continued his research up to his tragic death, due to suicide,
in 1971.

He was a vocal advocate of the serious study of UFOs and worked
tirelessly to promote the study of UFOs by academia and scientific
community [^2].

McDonald's, voluminous collection of correspondence, interviews that
included magnetic tape audio, and printed materials, predominately
relating to the period 1958 to 1971 are <a href="http://speccoll.library.arizona.edu/collections/james-e-mcdonald-papers">archived</a>
in the Special Collections at the <a href="http://library.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona
Library</a> (USA). He regarded the
radar-visual (RV) UFO sighting reports as being one of his most
important collections and hoped this archive would provide a valuable
source of information for future investigators. There are documents and
photographs that were collected by McDonald during his Australian visit
in the archive.

The original audio recordings (magnetic tapes) for the period 1967 to
1968 have been digitised and copied to CD-R media and are held by the
University of Arizona. The duplication of this material, including the
audio recordings may be requested, for a fee, from the [Special
Collections at the University of
Arizona.](http://speccoll.library.arizona.edu/duplications) Copyright
restrictions apply to the intended use of the documents and audio and
[permission to publish](http://speccoll.library.arizona.edu/permissions)
(including payment of a fee) must be obtained from the University before
any publication.

This significant audio collection includes the tape-recorded audio
interviews made during his visit to Australia (including Tasmania) in
June/July 1967. McDonald was hosted by the Victorian Flying Saucer
Research Society (VFSRS) located in Melbourne, Australia. During the
visit, members of that Society, such as Colin Norris, Paul Norman and
Jeff Rumpf were present during some of the interviews. In the following
year, 1968, VFSRS was renamed the Victorian UFO Research Society
(VUFORS).

A copy of these CDs' files was obtained from the Special Collections at
the University of Arizona Library, for research use. Permission to
publish the audio was not sought, due to cost. Therefore, the audio
files cannot be made available for download, or distribution to others.
We would like to thank the Special Collections of the University of
Arizona Library for providing the requested audio files.

Most of the 58 interviews that are summarised, in this document, were
tape recorded when McDonald visited Australia. The Australian collection
of audio, used for the summaries, has been archived, by the University,
on 21 CDs, with the identification numbers: 5, 11, 24, 25, 42, 43, 44,
45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58 and 59. Some of the
audio recordings relate to sightings that occurred in the USA and are
included in these summaries. It is likely that some of these reports
have not been previously published. Some of the audio files provided by
the University of Arizona had misspelt witness names and locations in
the file names, these have been corrected, to the best of our knowledge,
in the summaries.

The summaries in this document were transcribed from the audio, that was
originally recorded by McDonald using his hand-held magnetic tape, audio
recorder. He used this recorder during most interviews, and for some, he
recorded the telephone conversations with the witnesses. Listening to
the original audio gives a unique insight to the reports, that text
alone, is not able to convey.

The dialogue also coveys an historical dimension, as in some cases, the
witnesses have passed away and the speech is typical of mid 1960s,
Australian utterances.

A significant number of relatively famous Australian witnesses to UFO
sightings were interviewed during his visit, including Reverend William
Gill, an Anglican priest who observed craft-like UFOs, with what
appeared to be humanoid figures, on two consecutive evenings during 26
and 27 June, 1959, at Boianai, Papua New Guinea.

The interview with Barry Jones (Australian Federal Government Minister,
between 1983 and 1990), on his radio show, recorded on the 5 July 1967
(Identification Code/CD Number: T03S2/CD05) in Melbourne, reveals that
McDonald had been in Australia, investigating UFO reports, from the 24
June to the 10 July 1967.

Michael Swords at J Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies)</i>

The audio recordings demonstrate how dedicated McDonald had been to what
he termed, 'The UFO problem,' and he regarded, 'UFOs as the greatest
scientific problem of our time.' McDonald also states in the audio that
he is convinced that, at least, over the last 20 years, the Earth has
been, 'Visited and reconnaissance's by craft, that are not products of
our technology.' McDonald further stated that the evidence for UFOs is,
'Nothing short of astounding.'

The demeanour of McDonald's commentary and questioning of witnesses,
demonstrates that he was very methodical, intelligent and diligent in
his research.

# George Popovitch Comments on Kent Courtright Contacting Major Friend 

Identification Code/CD Number: CD05/T03S106

Date Recorded: after 20 September 1961

File Size: 8.08 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 8:49

Interview Details: George Popovitch comments on Kent Courtright's
difficulty and frustration in attempting to contact Major Friend at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), USA regarding a sighting by
Ernest Stadvec. The audio recording had been intended for Mr Fuller for
his magazine articles.

Sighting Date(s): 4 to 6 July 1961, 29 July 1961 and 3 to 4 August 1961

Sighting Time(s): Day and night

Location of Sighting(s): Akron/Cleveland, Ohio, USA

Duration of Sighting: Not discussed

Witness(es): Ernest Stadvec and other unnamed witnesses

Summary:

George Popovitch recounts the numerous phone calls that Kent Courtright
of WCUE Radio, Akron, USA, made attempting to contact Major Friend at
WPAFB. The calls were to follow up on the Air Force's conclusions on the
Ernest Stadvec sighting that occurred on 4 and 5 July 1961. Major Friend
was difficult to contact, and appeared to be deliberately avoiding
contact with Courtright. He was always claimed to be out of the office
when the calls were made by Courtright. His final attempts to contact
Major Friend had been made on 15 and 18 September 1961, without success.

Kent Courtwright was disgusted and called George Popovitch because he
wanted to send the tape of the conversation with Major Friend to James E
McDonald (refer summary CD05/T03S105 for conversation between Kent
Courtright and Captain Smith at RPAFB, dated 1 August 1961).

Popovitch decided to call WPAFB on the afternoon of the 18 September
1961 to attempt contact with Major Friend. Popovitch was told that Major
Friend was in Washington, USA, and that Captain Smith would be available
to speak (Ken Courtright was told earlier in the day that Captain Smith
would not be in for the day). Popovitch, 'Talked at length,' with
Captain Smith regarding the Air Force's conclusions on the Ernest
Stadvec sighting. The Air Force had apparently concluded that the
sighting was due to, 'Light refraction'. Popovitch asked for a copy of
the report on the incident to be posted to him, after one week he had
not received the report.

On the 20 September 1961, Ernest Stadvec and George Popovitch we on
public broadcast at Radio Station WCNS, USA. Stadvec complained to the
radio audience that he could not believe the conclusion made by Captain
Smith. He thought that attributing the sighting to, 'Light refraction'
was ridiculous and claimed that no true investigation was carried out by
the Air Force.

Popovitch stated if he receives the report from the Air Force he will
forward this to Mr Fuller for his magazine.

Two other sighting reports were discussed by Popovitch:

1.  A sighting that occurred on 3 and 4 August 1961 in the
    Cleveland/Akron, Ohio, USA referred to as the, 'Denver-Bennett
    incident.' This incident involved an object being 30 metres from a
    house at 10:15 pm at night on the 3 August 1961. The object
    apparently terrified the woman who was in the house. On the morning
    of the 4 August the women's husband also sighted the object.

2.  He had been out during the initial sighting. As a result, the
    Sheriff and Highway Patrol were called to the residence. This
    incident had coverage on the radio at the time and there were other
    reported witnesses. No other details of the sighting were given.

3.  On the 29 July 1961, a pilot and his pilot wife reported a sighting.
    No other details were given on this sighting.

This audio recording was apparently intended for Mr Fuller's UFO
magazine (the name of the magazine was not identified).

# Unidentified Sound Recorded from Mountain Ridge at East Hoquiam, Washington, USA 

Identification Code/CD Number: T03S107/CD05

Date Recorded: May 1967

File Size: 3.95 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 4:18

Interview Details: Unidentified sound recorded on a mountain ridge North
of Hoquiam, Washington, USA Sighting Date: May 1967

Witness(es): Not identified in the audio recording

Summary:

The recording was sent to James E McDonald by Betty Mc Clelland from
East Hoquiam, Washington, USA during May 1967 and transcribed by
McDonald onto another tape. Betty was identified by McDonald as being
the Civil Defence (CD) Co-ordinator, at Grays Harbour County,
Washington.

The audio of the unidentified sound was recorded on a mountain ridge
North of Hoquiam, Washington.

McDonald states that the unidentified sound had been heard for
approximately the last 30 days in the area, and that, 'Has a bleeping
sound that has puzzled the CD officials.'

The recording of the unidentified sound starts at 0:41 and finishes at
the end of the audio at 4:18.

The unidentified sound, the bleep, has a near regular cycle frequency,
estimated to be 0.5 seconds (two bleeps per second). There appears to be
some noise superimposed from the recording/transcription process.

A male and female voice can be heard, at various times, in the
background, speaking to each other. The words spoken are near
incomprehensible due to the interference of the louder unidentified
sound. The identity of these persons is not known and they had obviously
recorded the unidentified sound.

The cause of this unidentified sound is unknown, and therefore remains a
mystery.

# Barry Jones Radio Show with James McDonald, Australia, 5 July 1967 

Identification Code/CD Number: T03S2/CD05

Date Recorded: 5 July 1967

File Size: 34.9 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 38:08

Interview Details: Barry Jones interviews James McDonald on 3DB radio in
Australia.

Summary:

Barry Jones, talking on 3DB radio Melbourne, refers to page 24 of the
<i>Sun</i> newspaper, and states, 'You will notice a small advertisement,'
asking people who have witnessed a UFO, to phone the radio station
between 9 and 10 am. Jones qualifies this by stating that he has
Professor James E McDonald in the studio, as a guest, to answer
questions and to take reports of UFO sightings. Jones introduces
McDonald as a Senior Atmospheric Physicist and Professor of Meteorology
at the University of Arizona (USA).

Jones asks McDonald, 'How long have you been in Australia?' he answers,
'Since the 24 (June), almost two weeks.' McDonald comments that there
are lots of astronomers in Arizona and that it is the location of the
Kitt Peak National Observatory and that he studies cloud physics and
weather modification.

Jones askes McDonald about his interest in, 'Flying saucers,' McDonald
answers stating that has had a fulltime interest for a year and a casual
interest for the last 10 or 12 years.

Jones states that McDonald has described, 'UFOs as the greatest
scientific problem of our time.' Jones asked if he, McDonald, was
serious when he made this statement? McDonald reaffirms his statement.

Jones asks McDonald to comment on this conclusion, McDonald states that
that he is convinced that at least, over the last 20 years, the Earth
has been, 'visited and reconnaissance's by craft, that are not products
of our technology.' McDonald further stated that the evidence is,
'Nothing short of astounding.'

McDonald comments that the implications for man are enormous and
unfortunately the problem is generally regarded as nonsense. Various
mundane explanations are made for the phenomena, such as naturally
occurring objects, Venus for example, and that the witnesses are
incompetent. McDonald counters that argument by stating there is a large
volume of reports that describe objects that have the appearance of a
machine and therefore could not be confused with naturally occurring
objects.

Jones opens callers to the radio station to ask questions to McDonald.

The first caller identifies himself as, 'Horton,' he states he cannot
believe in the possibility of interplanetary visitors coming to Earth,
and that he favours a scientific explanation such as, a 'Plasma.'
McDonald states that this explanation is due to only one writer from
Aviation Week (USA) magazine, named Philip Klass. McDonald comments that
not all witnesses are seeing luminous objects, like plasmas, but instead
solid metallic looking objects, some close, that resemble craft. They
hover, move at high speed and in no way, resemble, hazy luminous
plasmoid objects, that are naturally occurring and uncommon.

The second caller is Mrs Smith from South Caulfield, Melbourne. She
explained to McDonald that she saw a cigar shaped object in the sky in
1949 over Hawthorn, Victoria at about 9 to 9.30 pm. It was stationary
and had a dull light inside with lighting from top to bottom. She
watched it for some time and got her daughter out to have a look. It was
a clear night.

She called the <i>Sun</i> newspaper to report the object and was told by the
person on the switchboard that he had also seen the object and that the
newspaper was inundated with calls to report this object. There was a
small article on the sighting in the <i>Sun</i> newspaper the following day.
McDonald made the comment that since the object was stationary, and that
there was no lightning, this ruled out several naturally occurring
causes, including plasmoids.

The third caller had witnessed a, 'Shooting star,' that paused then
moved in another direction. McDonald commented, 'That this is a
dangerous category, with reference to, misinterpretation.' McDonald
stated that many witnesses see this type of flight behaviour and that
there may be many causes, some being for example, a helicopter.

The fourth caller witnessed about five years ago (1962), at 9 am in the
morning an object hovering over metropolitan Melbourne at Eastern Hill.
The object was described as cylindrical and silvery in colour before
disappearing. The sky was clear. The reporter wondered why others had
not reported this object. McDonald commented that people for various
reasons do not report sightings and that some fear ridicule.

McDonald talked about some of the reports he had investigated on site
with the Melbourne Flying Saucer Association, one that occurred in Moe,
in the Gippsland region of Victoria. The witness, who was a farmer, had
been milking his cows during February 1963 when a large saucer shaped
object hovered over a tree about 100 metres away. The farmer reported
that the cattle and horses stampeded in panic as a result of the
sighting.

Barry, asked McDonald about his visit to the United Nations (UN) to
speak about UFOs to the Outer Space Affairs Group on the 7 June 1967.
McDonald stated that he had submitted formal statements urging the UN to
act on the UFO problem. McDonald added that he had arranged to speak to
Mr U Thant who is the Secretary General of the UN, unfortunately this
did not occur, due to problems in the Middle East. McDonald claimed that
the Secretary General of the UN has stated that the UFO phenomena is one
of the most important international problems facing mankind. McDonald
hoped that scientific groups would be setup by the UN to study UFOs.

The fifth caller recounted a sighting he had ten years ago (1957) while
working as a civil engineer surveying the first geothermal power station
in Wairakei, New Zealand. He and his assistant saw a flying saucer that
rose in the distance and went up vertically, faster than an aircraft.
They could see the UFO pass in front of and behind clouds as it moved in
the sky. McDonald asked how far away it was and the person replied that
it was about three kilometres away, dark grey in colour and its height
was about 150 metres. His assistant denied seeing the object when they
reported the event to their colleagues.

Jones asked McDonald about the official standing of UFOs with the USA
Airforce. McDonald claimed that they treat the phenomena as, 'A
nuisance,' and a burden that they must deal with, adding that the USA
Airforce's Project Blue Book has only three investigators, for such a
large project.

The sixth caller recounted a sighting she had on 17 November 1955 at
Christchurch, New Zealand while on a train. She sighted two spinning
white coloured objects in the sky that disappeared after a while.

The seventh caller reported a sighting that occurred in East Prestons,
Victoria on the 8 March 1965 at 8 pm. Her daughter also saw the object,
it was described as a, 'Spinning top,' and iridescent blue. The object
was viewed with binoculars and it was a clear night.

McDonald was asked by Jones when he was going back to the USA and he
said, 'The tenth (July 1967) after going to Tasmania and up to the
northern part of the country.'

<i>Editor's note: Barry Jones later moved into politics and served in
several Ministerial portfolios in the Australian Federal Government,
between 1983 and 1990.</i>

<i>This interview reveals that McDonald had been in Australia,
investigating UFO reports, from the 24 June 1967 to the 10 July 1967.</i>

# Gary Taylor\'s Death and Ronald Sullivan\'s Sighting of 4 April 1966 

Identification Code/CD Number: T08S101/CD11

Date Recorded: June 1967

File Size: MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 2:02

Interview Details: Audio sent to McDonald on the reports relating to the
Burkes Flat UFO incident Sighting Date: 4 April 1966 and a few days
earlier

Sighting Time: Night

Location of Sighting: Burkes Flat, Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Minutes

Witness(es): Ronald Sullivan and one other unidentified person

Summary:

An unidentified person recorded an audio report for McDonald (McDonald's
voice is not heard in this recording). The person starts by saying that
he had sent McDonald a newspaper cutting from the <i>Sun</i> newspaper
regarding a boy (Gary Taylor), who was killed when his car ran off the
road, north of Melbourne (the location is known to be Burkes Flat, a few
days before 4 April 1966).

The person states that a couple of nights after this accident another
person (Ronald Sullivan) saw strange lights in the field beside where
Gary Taylor's car had crashed. The person, Ronald Sullivan, had
described that the headlight beams of his car, 'Bent around as if they
had been attracted by some fantastic magnetic force,' when he passed the
lights in the field.

A few days after the newspaper article, Peter Norris from the Victorian
Flying Saucer Research Society (VFSRS) was contacted by an unidentified
person from Bendigo, Victoria. This person reported that his car had
been travelling 400 metres behind Gary Taylor's car just before the
accident. He said that he saw, 'Strange lights,' in the adjacent field
and turned off a side road because he was frightened. He then heard a
crashing sound, and that he did not realise this was a car crash. Peter
Norris stated that the person sounded agitated and asked this person to
contact the Bendigo newspaper or the Police.

<i>Editor's note: The events described in this audio recording are
generally known, in the literature, as the 1966 Burkes Flat UFO
Incident, Victoria, Australia. This event occurred on the 4 April 1966.</i>

<i>This sighting is noteworthy since it describes the rarely reported
phenomena of 'bent light' beams. There is a YouTube video on this
incident at: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_n8FgLGkKI">https://youtu.be/c_n8FgLGkKI</a></i>

# Saucer Nest at Tully, Queensland, January 1966 and Strange Ring Like Marking Near Albany, NSW

Witness(es): Not identified in audio recording

Summary:

An unidentified Australian reporter comments that, 'Rings,' in the grass
that were found near Albury, NSW, Australia and in Bankstown, NSW,
Australia may be related to the Tully, Queensland, Australia UFO
sighting.

The reporter comments that the rings found in NSW, "Cannot be explained
away as 'fairy-rings.' " The reporter explains that the grass was,
'Crushed down,' and that the grass appeared to be dead or dying.

In contrast, 'The Rings,' at Tully, 'Were twisted as if what had touched
down had rotated.' This had not been reported to have occurred with the
grass at Albury.

A report (in the USA, possibly reported by James E McDonald) is
mentioned about two Sheriffs that had chased a, 'Possible UFO.' The
comment was made that, 'Your friend,' had checked this report at the
Planetarium.

<i>Editor's note: This report was recorded by an unidentified Australian.</i>

<i>The tape was probably given to McDonald during his trip to Australia,
between 24 June 1967 and 10 July 1967.</i>

<i>McDonald is not heard on this recording.</i>

<i>The report refers to the famous UFO sighting that occurred in Tully,
Queensland on 19 January 1966, when a 'saucer' shaped object rose from
Horseshoe Lagoon leaving an impression on the lagoon vegetation,
referred to as a 'saucer nest' in various publications.</i>

a Captain in the Australian Army Legal Corps. At this meeting the
Captain stated that, 'On the twenty fourth of last month,' the captain
was an observer at Puckapunyal Army Base.

The Captain had been observing seven <i>Centurion Tanks</i> on the firing
range at 2 am in the morning of the twenty fourth. While the tanks were
firing shells a UFO rose from the ground about 700 yards (640 metres)
away. The tanks immediately stop firing and the personnel watched the
UFO rise to about 60 to 70 feet (18 to 20 metres) in the air. The UFO
appeared to stop and, 'Wobble slightly on its axis.' The object was
described as, 'Dome shaped with a blueish metal reflecting in the moon
light.' There were 23 Army personnel observing the UFO. The UFO,
'Appeared to be damaged on one side as if, 'Bashed in around the rim,'
this looked like, 'A poor panel beating job.' In addition, the UFO
appeared to have a patch of, 'Oil,' on the side that appeared damaged.

The UFO moved towards the tanks and stopped 150 yards (140 metres) away
and an aperture opened on the UFO that appeared, 'Like the iris of a
camera lens.' At this time one of the tanks gunners aimed the tank gun
at the UFO and the iris, 'Snapped shut.' The UFO then moved to flank the
tanks on the left 150 yards (140 metres) away.

The personnel described the UFO as being 45 to 50 feet (14 to 15 metres)
in diameter and moving at the speed of a <i>Cessna</i> spotting aircraft that
are used by the Army.

The UFO moved away to the West and appeared to be deliberately avoiding
the position of the tank guns aim.

The next day (25 April) they located a depressed area about ten feet (3
metres) across (assumed to be in the location where the UFO had risen
from, but not stated in the audio) with traces of oil, possibly from the
tanks.

The reporter makes the comment that he is inclined to believe the report
by the Captain and that the veracity of the report is problematic due to
the secrecy of the Army. He further comments that most military services
accept that UFOs exist.

Peter Norris, a UFO researcher with Victorian Flying Saucer Research
Society (VFSRS), was advised of this report, he stated that he would
follow up the sighting with his Army contacts. Peter has also written a
letter to the Secretary of the Army regarding this sighting.

The reporter states that the Secretary of the VFSRS is friendly with the
wife of the Commander at the Puckapunyal Army Base so there may be
information provided by the Army because of the letter.

<i>Editor's note: This report was recorded by an unidentified Australian.</i>

<i>The tape was probably given to McDonald during his trip to Australia,
between 24 June 1967 and 10 July 1967.</i>

<i>McDonald is not heard on this recording.</i>

<i>At the start of the interview the unidentified reporter states, 'The
24th of last month,' to explain when the sighting occurred. If the
recording was made in 1967 when McDonald visited Australia, then it is
possible that the sighting occurred on the 24 April 1967, instead of the
24 April 1966 as recorded on the tape, possibly incorrectly.</i>

# James Kibel\'s 19 February 1957 UFO sighting in Melbourne, Australia

File Size: 2.5 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 2:36

Interview Details: James Kibel comments on the 19 February 1957 sighting
in Melbourne, Australia Sighting Date: 19 February 1957

Sighting Time: 1.00 pm

Location of Sighting: Deepdene, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: 10 minutes

Witness(es): James Johnson Kibel his fiancée Jill and his mother

Summary:

James Kibel and two others were sitting in the back yard of his mother's
house, located at 1-3 Palm Grove, Deepdene, Melbourne. It was a
beautiful, very warm and clear sky day. Kibel's mother noticed a glint
in the sky and drew the attention of the others to it. It looked like a
little blob of pink light in the sky. It appeared to get bigger and they
all said it was like the top of a mushroom. It was stationary for ten
minutes and bright pink in colour.

There was a camera without film in the house. After ten minutes, it
turned a bright white; bright like the Sun. It started to rock backwards
and forwards like a seesaw, then moved rapidly away towards the horizon.
It was, 'Falling like a leaf,' and may have descended slightly.

Kibel said there are theories put forward by A Michel, in France, about
objects descending in height as they move across the surface of the
earth. He then corrected himself and said the theory came from Plantier,
in France.

The sighting had startled them and they had read about UFOs. Kibel got
in touch with Peter Norris from the Victorian Flying Saucer Research
Society (VFSRS) and reported the sighting. Kibel thought the report was
published in an early issue of <i>Flying Saucer Review</i>.

After the sighting Kibel, his mother and fiancée (later his wife) became
interested in UFOs and gathered information about them.

<i>Editor's note: Although the file title shows a date of 19 February
1957, in a taped interview with Kibel about his 1966 photograph, Kibel
provides the date of this sighting as 19 February 1958.</i>

# Westall High School Sighting 6 April 1966 from May/June 1966, APRO Bulletin 

Identification Code/CD Number: T08S105/CD11

Date Recorded: After June 1966

File Size: 8.55 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 9:20

Interview Details: Jim Kibel talks about the 6 April 1966 sighting of a
UFO near Westall High School Sighting Date: 6 April 1966

Sighting Time: Day time

Location of Sighting: Westall High School, Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: over 20 minutes

Witness(es): Students and teachers at Westall High School, particularly
Mr Greenwood who was the Science

Master at the school and an unidentified Physical Education teacher

Summary:

An unidentified person (Jim Kibel) highlights inaccuracies in some of
the Australian UFO sightings documented <i>Aerial Phenomena Research
Organization (APRO) Bulletin</i>. For example, Jim comments that his
photograph of a UFO had been published the wrong way around, in the last
APRO Bulletin (May-June 1966).

One report in the <i>APRO Bulletin</i> is the UFO sighting that occurred at
the Westall High School. This sighting refers to about 300 children,
including two teachers, one being the Science Master, who watched a UFO
manoeuvring away from five aircraft. The aircraft were reported to be
from the local Aero Club. The heading in the Bulletin is quoted as,
'Officials Squash School Sighting.'

Kibel comments that his brother-in-law is on the committee of the
<i>Australian Light Car Club</i> and that the Science Master at the Westall
High School is also a member. Through his brother-in-law, Kibel arranges
a meeting with the Science Master, at Kibel's house, to discuss the UFO
sighting at the school. Kibel claims that during this meeting the
Science Master, who was identified as Mr Greenwood, read the <i>APRO
Bulletin</i> article on the sighting and that he claimed most of the facts
were incorrect. Mr Greenwood also stated to Kibel, that the Headmaster
was so scarred that he refused to go outside when told that there was an
object in the sky. According to Greenwood, when the Australian Airforce
(RAAF) contacted the Headmaster about the sighting, he apparently told
them, 'Go and jump in the lake.'

Kibel states that the inaccuracies in the <i>APRO Bulletin</i> may indicate
that Carol Lorenzen (Secretary and Editor of the Bulletin) had not
collected the correct information for the publication.

Greenwood's account, via Kibel, alleges that he, Greenwood, was first
notified of the sighting by a hysterical student who said that there was
a flying saucer outside. Greenwood then apparently went outside, and
initially could not see anything and then ran over to a group of
students, then he saw the UFO.

The UFO was described as hovering close to the overhead high voltage
power lines that were adjacent to the school. He described the object
as, 'Being like bright silver and about the size of a car,' and,
'Resembled a bar or rod hovering in the air, a disk thing from the
edge.' A light plane, like a Cessna was seen moving towards the UFO.

The UFO was hovering at about 1000 feet (300 metres) and about 2000 feet
(600 metres) from where Greenwood was standing. At this stage, more
students arrived, including the Physical Education teacher.

Apparently, the pilot of the first plane had radioed others, and four
planes were now converging on the UFO. The planes were flying very close
to each other. As the planes got closer to the UFO it would accelerate
away and stop. The planes would again follow the UFO and the same
evasive action occurred. This flight behaviour went on for about 20
minutes while the students and teachers were watching. The Headmaster
finally came over and told everybody to return to their classes, this
they did.

Later the Headmaster told the students that they would be punished if
they talked about this sighting and the teachers were told that they may
lose their jobs. According to Kibel, the threat by the Headmaster had
appalled Greenwood.

Kibel states that Greenwood said to him that he was sceptical of UFOs
until this sighting changed his thinking on this subject.

Kibel said that Greenwood told him that the Physical Education teacher
refused to make any utterances about what he had seen, and that
Greenwood did not think this refusal was due to the threats by the
Headmaster.

Greenwood asked one of the older students, a girl, to describe what she
had seen and this matched his observation. Greenwood claimed that, 'Half
an hour later,' when he asked the same student about the sighting she
would not say anything, the reason for this puzzled Greenwood.

Kibel stated that the sighting was not published in any of the papers,
except for a local newspaper in Dandenong, Victoria.

Kibel stated that the UFO was about half the length of a <i>Cessna</i>
aircraft, and according to Greenwood, 'The UFO appeared to be under
intelligent control.'

<i>Editor's note: The unidentified person speaking in this audio recording
is Jim Kibel. This is inferred from the reference to, 'His photograph,'
of a UFO on the front page of the May-June APRO Bulletin.</i>

<i>The veracity of Greenwood's account of the UFO sighting, as described
by Kibel, cannot be verified.</i>

<i>The date of the sighting is incorrectly identified as the 7 April 1966,
in the file name of the audio file supplied by the University of
Arizona.</i>

# World of Space and Science - Don Allen ABC, USA Radio Program with James McDonald, March 1967 

Identification Code/CD Number: 5T04S1/CD24

Date Recorded: 19 March 1967

File Size: 11 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 11:46

Interview Details: Don Allen of the ABC (American Broadcasting
Corporation) Radio's, <i>World of Space and Science</i>, Los Angles,
California USA, interviews James McDonald. The interview with McDonald
was prerecorded in Tucson, Arizona prior to being aired on the radio
program.

Summary:

James McDonald is introduced by Don Allen as being a Senior Physicist in
Institute of Atmospheric Physics at The University of Arizona, USA and
that he has studied the UFO phenomena for the last year.

A series of questions were given to McDonald during the interview.

McDonald was asked regarding the reality of UFOs, he replied that after
ten months of investigation he is convinced that they exist, 'In our
atmosphere.'

McDonald was asked what prompted him to start investigating the
phenomena, he replied that he had been investigating at a, 'Low pitched
level,' for years and had always been puzzled by the phenomena. McDonald
mentioned the UFO sightings that occurred last spring in Michigan, USA
and in Tucson.

McDonald was asked about the evidence for UFOs, McDonald claimed that
there were many observations from credible persons, both in the USA and
overseas. McDonald claimed that the volume of sightings reported in the
last twenty years, 'Is nothing short of astounding.'

McDonald cautioned that misidentification of naturally occurring, and
man-made objects, including hoaxes, is part of the, 'Noise,' of sighting
reports. McDonald claimed that he could satisfy himself, after talking
to witnesses, that sightings could be dismissed, as a hoax or
misinterpretation. The interesting reports that he was referring to were
objects that are unusual and appear to be machines or craft, and in some
cases, seen at very close distances, where misinterpretation would be
unlikely.

McDonald was asked about the attitude of the Airforce in the USA towards
UFOs, McDonald mentioned the Project Blue Book investigation of UFOs. He
said that the government was, 'So disturbed,' by the volume of UFO
reports in 1952/1953 that they commenced the <i>Robertson Panel</i> in 1953.
He lamented that the panel worked for only three days and concluded that
UFOs were not of extra-terrestrial origin and posed no threat. McDonald
claimed that the CIA then decided that the volume of UFO sightings was,
'Clogging up the system,' and that debunking would be used to help
reduce the public interest in the subject. This led to the August 1953,
<i>Air Force Regulation 200-2 (AFR 200-2)</i> and <i>JANAP 146</i> in the USA.

McDonald claimed that the Air Force had downgraded the UFO reports to a,
'Nuisance.' He added that the Airforce's <i>Project Blue Book</i>
investigating UFO reports was a low priority group that comprised, only
a Major, Sargent, First Lieutenant and Secretary at Wright Patterson
Airforce Base. McDonald claimed that the Airforce were, 'Victims of
their own propaganda,' and that there appeared to be no cover-up by the
Department of Defence (USA).

When asked, 'What are UFOs up to?', McDonald said he could not say with
any certainty. His hypothesis is that they are of extra-terrestrial
origin and possibly conducting reconnaissance on Earth.

McDonald said that he had not seen a UFO except for lights in the sky.
He claimed that there were more reports of disk and cigar shaped UFOs.

He stated that the greatest wave of UFO sightings occurred in France
during September/October 1954 and, secondly, the reports in the USA
during 1952.

McDonald stated that some people may not report sightings due to the
fear of ridicule. Therefore, there may be a significant number of
unreported sightings.

When asked where do the UFOs come from, McDonald speculated that it is
more likely that they originate outside in our Solar System and
therefore interstellar travel is required.

# Peter Norris Radio Interview, Australia 

Identification Code/CD Number: 5T05S1/CD25

Date Recorded: 1965 (determined from the comment that, 1959 was six
years ago, when referring to the William Gill sighting)

File Size: 7.7 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 8:23

Interview Details: Peter Norris from the Victorian Flying Saucer
Research Society (VFSRS) is interviewed by an unidentified person on
radio

Summary:

The interview started with Peter Norris talking about the formation of
the federal UFO group that would represent all of Australia's UFO
societies. At the end of the interview Peter is referred to as being the
President of the newly formed Commonwealth Aerial Phenomena
Investigation Organisation (CAPIO).

Peter was asked about the UFO societies in Australia and he replied,
"Their are considerable numbers.' He went on to say that there is at
least one society in each state, except Tasmania where there is none,
South Australia and Western Australia have two societies.

When asked what is the approach of VUFORS he said, 'Trying to foster an
objective approach to the subject; a scientific investigation.'

Peter explained that VUFORS deal with, 'First-hand information, as much
as it is available,' including the exchange of reports and information
with international UFO groups. He said that the Society publishes a
twice yearly magazine.

Peter said that William Gill's 1959 sighting investigation is
continuing. He added that Gill attended their convention with his
friend, Norman Crutwell from New Guinea, to answer questions from the
audience. Peter also stated that there was a Royal Australian Airforce
(RAAF) representative, Mr Roberts, at the convention to answer
questions, he was identified as the Senior Research Scientist at the
RAAF, Canberra.

Peter said that the RAAF was actively investigating UFO sightings
through the RAAF's Intelligence division. The comment was made that the
RAAF investigates some UFO reports before VUFORS is able to start their
investigations.

When asked about the use of instruments, Peter said that the use of
instruments to assist sightings investigations was limited due to the
unpredictability of sightings. He added that their expeditions to One
Tree Hill in the Dandenong Mountains, near Melbourne, had been
unsuccessful since no UFOs were sighted.

When Peter was referring to the William Gill sighting he said that Mr T
Dury, who was the Chief of the Civil Aviation Authority in New Guinea,
in 1953, filmed on several frames of his video, an object that he was
unable to identify. He claims that the video was sent to the RAAF for
analysis, they in turn sent the video to the USA. Peter then said, 'What
happened to the film after that is a mystery.'

<i>Editor's note: This interview is predominately about Gill's famous 1959
UFO sightings and is interspersed with general discussion on subjects
completely unrelated to UFOs. Coincidently, this interview occurred
almost exactly eight years after Gill's sightings New Guinea.</i>

<i>Reverend William B Gill, who was an Anglican priest with a mission in
Boianai, Papua New Guinea, observed, with others, craft-like UFOs, one
with humanoid figures, on the evenings of the 26 and 27 June 1959.
Approximately twenty-five people, including teachers and medical
technicians, also observed the phenomena. They 'signalled' to the
humanoids and received an apparent response. This was one of many UFO
sightings within a few weeks in New Guinea.</i>

<i>Gill documented the sightings with Reverend Norman Crutwell and
subsequently the Australian media obtained these reports. After the
reports were published, in August 1959, there was a media sensation,
particularly in Australia.</i>

<i>Both William Gill and Norman Crutwell were Ministers in the Anglican
Church and normally have the prefix, Reverend, before their names.</i>

File Size: 46.2 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 48:05

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Jim Kibel (Part 1)

Sighting Date: 2 April 1966 (Also describes sightings on about the 19
November 1958, and in 1954) Sighting Time: 2.21 pm

Location of Sighting: Deepdene, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Six seconds

Witness(es): James Johnson Kibel

Summary:

James Kibel was in the garden at his parents' house, on the western
side. He was intending to use a <i>Polaroid 800</i> camera, with out of date
Polaroid film, to take photographs of the garden. Suddenly, there was a
terrific flash of light, which illuminated the area around him. He
turned to face east and saw an unusual object, descending, almost
vertically, in a sort of, 'Bouncing,' motion. It looked like a mushroom
with the stalk facing downwards and the domed top, facing upwards. There
was no noise associated with the object. The object was reflecting the
Sun and was very brilliant.

He noted that the wind was blowing hard, from the north, and that the
air temperature was about 26 degrees Centigrade. There was scattered
cirrus clouds in the sky. The object then pivoted, so that the stalk was
facing south and the bell top was facing north. At this point, while it
remained stationary for about half a second he took one <i>Polaroid</i>
photograph of the object. It then rotated 90 degrees, so that the stalk
was now facing him.

The object then, 'Rolled,' to the north. After, 'Rolling,' the object
lost altitude, jerked back upwards, then left at speed to the north. It
was lost to view behind trees. Kibel then went to seek out a workman
whom he knew to be elsewhere in the garden. He pulled the film out of
the camera, and he and the workman, a Mr English, watched as the film
developed and the image appeared. Kibel is not aware of any other
witnesses in the neighbourhood.

Although the single image, showed a, 'Mushroom,' shaped silvery object
with pink reflections on part of its surface. Kibel states that at the
time he wasn't aware of seeing these reflections. He told McDonald that
he had the impression that the object looked it was manufactured, and
that he was sure it wasn't a small object. Although it had been very
windy, the wind did not appear to have any effect on the object or its
movements.

Kibel also described two other sightings which had been made from the
same garden, but from the eastern side of the house.

The first of these sighting occurred about the 19 November 1958 at 12.15
pm. Kibel, his fiancée, and his mother were sitting outside on a warm
day. Kibel was the first to notice a speck of light in the sky, some 15
to 20 degrees from the Sun. He thought, at first, that it might be a
planet as he was aware Venus was visible sometimes in the daytime. He
went into the house and brought out the 7x50 field binoculars for the
observation. The object was a definite mushroom shape. It was bright,
iridescent pink in colour. It then moved away from the Sun until it was
overhead.

Both his fiancée and his mother could also see it. It remained
stationary in this position for about 25 minutes. Then it became
intensely bright white in colour. At the bottom, it was like a ball of
white light with, 'Fuzz,' around it and a pink cap. Kibel estimated its
angular size as about two to three minutes of arc. Then the whole thing
turned into a very bright, bright as the Sun, white coloured light with,
'Fuzz,' around it. It then started to move and descended, like a falling
leaf to the horizon where it was lost from view. They reported the
sighting to Peter Norris of the Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society
(VFSRS).

The second of these sighting occurred during 1954 when Kibel's mother
saw a disc in the eastern sky and called Kibel to have a look. It
appeared to flip over continually, showing first a dark, black side;
then a bright, white side. It disappeared behind tall trees in the back
garden. The time had been about 5 pm, perhaps in August, late winter.
Its angular size was estimated to be that of a ten cent coin, held at
arm's length. It was likely to be thin as it disappeared at times. There
were no known witnesses. His mother reported this sighting to a
Melbourne newspaper but was accused of having been drinking.

The interview ended with some comments from Kibel. There was a Royal
Australian Airforce (RAAF) radio training school about one kilometre
from the house. All three objects were there in the sky. The object he
photographed appeared to be a machine. He had sat down and looked at the
photograph for hours after it was taken. He did not see the pink
reflections on its surface when he saw it, only later when looking at
the coloured image.

He knew of other cases where photographs had been taken, but had been
confiscated. He said he was aware that Air Force Intelligence had a
large file of photographs. However, he said he was not able to talk
about this information.

summaries.</i>

# Interviews Sir George Jones 

Identification Code/CD Number: 3T10S102/43

Date Recorded: 5.30 pm Wednesday, 28 June 1967

File Size: 14.4 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 15:44

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Sir George Jones in
Melbourne

Sighting Date: 16 October 1957 (see editor's note)

Sighting Time: Early evening

Location of Sighting: Over Port Phillip Bay, Melbourne, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Ten seconds

Witness(es): Sir George Jones and his wife

Summary:

Sir George Jones describes his sighting to McDonald. Jones states that
one evening he and his wife had driven home to their house near the
beach. As he got out of his car, his wife said, 'Look what is that.'
They both witnessed a bright object approaching from the south over Port
Phillip Bay, Melbourne. The object passed over their heads and
disappeared to the north. The night was clear with a light breeze.

Jones could not remember the date of the sighting but thought it was
about three years ago.

His first thought was that the object must have been one of the Russian
Sputniks disintegrating. Then he considered a metrological balloon with
a light. He decided that since the object was estimated to be travelling
at 400 mph (640 km/hr) it could not be a balloon.

Jones was mystified by the sighting, and estimated its height to be
15,000 feet (4.5 kilometres). No sound was heard coming from the object.
The light was a brilliant white, larger than street lights, but smaller
than the moon, and, 'Surrounded by a mysterious envelope.' McDonald
suggested that it may have been a meteor, however Jones discounted this
as there was no evidence of any disintegration.

Jones claims that no others in his neighbourhood witnessed this object.
The sighting lasted about ten seconds.

Jones claims that the sighting occurred three days after the burial of
Sir Thomas White (26 April 1888 to 13 October 1957) and that this
sighting had been reported, with some ridicule, in the <i>Herald</i>
newspaper.

This was the Jones' only sighting.

McDonald asks Jones about his connections with the Royal Australian
Airforce (RAAF) when he was Chief of Staff. Jones claims that the
attitude at the RAAF was sceptical and that mundane explanations could
explain all sightings. Jones recounts that while he was in the RAAF he
was sent to Geelong to investigate a report of five unidentified objects
witnessed in the sky.

Jones asks McDonald, if Reverend William Gill is, 'Still sticking to his
guns,' McDonald replied, 'Yes, I am seeing him tonight.'

<i>Editor's note: Sir George Jones (1896-1992) was a senior commander in
the Royal Australian Airforce rising to the rank of Air Marshal.</i>

<i>Sir Thomas White died on the 13 October 1957 in Melbourne, Australia.
His burial would have been a few days after his death. Therefore, the
sighting referred to in this interview could have occurred on or near
the 16 October 1957, that is three days after the burial. This sighting
date is collaborated by the report ^\[1\]^ published in the Aerial
Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) Bulletin. This date is
significantly earlier than Jones recollection in the interview, when he
stated that the sighting had occurred three years earlier, that would be
during 1964.</i>

# Interviews Andrew Greenwood 

Identification Code/CD Number: 3T10S103/CD43

Date Recorded: 28 June 1967

File Size: 25.6 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 26:41

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Andrew Greenwood regarding
sighting of UFOs Sighting Date: 6 April 1966

Sighting Time: 10:15 am

Location of Sighting: Westall High School, Clayton, Melbourne, Victoria,
Australia

Duration of Sighting: About 25 minutes

Witness(es): Andrew Greenwood

Summary:

McDonald had read the material on the case sent to him by Paul Norman
and Peter Norris from the Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society
(VFSRS). Greenwood did not recall the date of the incident but was
prompted by McDonald that date was 6 April 1966. Greenwood then
described the incident.

Greenwood said the incident started when a female student raced into his
class saying, 'Flying saucer outside.' She left the room, and then 5-10
minutes later it was morning recess, so Greenwood went outside to look
for himself.

At the time, the school had 500 to 600 students and more than half of
them were on the school oval beside the school buildings.

The object was to the south of the school, and airborne at all times. It
was a grey colour against a bluegrey sky. At first, Greenwood could not
see the object due to the lack of contrast against the sky, students
pointed it out to him. It appeared to be two-thirds the length of a
<i>Cessna</i> aircraft. It was cigar shaped, elliptical and at times,
'Bulged' in the middle; it changed shape. He estimated that the
electricity pylons visible in the distance were 300 metres away. From
this, he estimated that the object was one kilometre at its furthest and
500 metres at its closest approach.

Describing the object motions Greenwood said that it hovered at times.
It would accelerate and disappear from sight, then someone would see it
in another part of the sky. The object moved through an arc of perhaps
30 degrees, came towards them, at times, and sometimes went up and down.
In summary, it hovered, moved slowly, and at times, fast.

When he first sighted the object, it was on its own. Then he saw one
aircraft approach the object, then it moved to another part of the sky
very rapidly, and the aircraft followed. It seemed to be playing 'cat
and mouse' with the plane. Altogether there were five aircraft visible,
Moorabbin Airport later said there were no aircraft in the vicinity. The
Airport is about eight kilometres away. If you ever go to the Airport
there are always aircraft in air.

At one stage the object disappeared behind a row of tall pine trees that
were located about 600 metres away. Later, Greenwood and another staff
member, Claude Miller, went over to the trees but saw nothing unusual.

Estimating the duration of the event, Greenwood said that the girls at
the physical education class on the oval saw it 10 minutes before he
did. He then watched it for about 15 minutes. Therefore, the total
duration of the sighting had been about 25 minutes.

The object was a silvery colour against the sky. He lost sight of it as
it vanished by accelerating away and was lost from sight. The aircraft
were still there at this point. Asked about the ratio of the object's
length to width, Greenwood estimated a ratio of 4 or 5:1. Greenwood did
not hear any noises that he associated with the object.

Greenwood saw other objects go over the school fence while he watched
this object. Asked about the time of the event Greenwood said it was
morning recess when he saw it. He calculated the time at 9 am plus two
forty-minute-long teaching periods which would make the start of his
observation as about 10.20 am. However, he then said 10.15am. Recess was
15 minutes long.

Asked who else saw the object, he said, 'The physical education teacher
Jeanette Muir and the senior

English teacher Claude Miller \[Muir?\], who saw it last.' The
Headmaster of the school was Frank

Sambleble. The Headmaster spoke to the students at the assemble on 6
April 1966 about this incident.

The Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) officers didn't come to the school
for about two to three days. The Headmaster told Greenwood that a RAAF
officer came to the school and that he wouldn't let the RAAF office
interview Greenwood as he was teaching. Greenwood understood that the
RAAF officer was only in the Headmaster's room for a few minutes.

At the time of this interview Greenwood was teaching science at,
Haileybury College. The age of the Westall High School students was 11
to 16 years.

Moorabbin Airport was contacted by the <i>Dandenong Journal</i>. The Journal
interviewed dozens of people in the area but found no one who had seen
the object. If it wasn't pointed out to you, you may not have been able
to see the object.

Greenwood closed by saying, 'If people try and hide things, I want to
find out more about them, it must be my perverse nature.'

# Interviews Reverend William Gill 

Identification Code/CD Number: 3T10S2/CD44

Date Recorded: Started at 7.10 pm on 28 June 1967 in Melbourne,
Australia File Size: 56.8 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 60:00

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Reverend William Gill
(deceased) about his 1959 UFO sighting in Boianai, Papua New Guinea

Summary:

McDonald asks Gill if the Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) are
continuing to suggest that his UFO sightings had a mundane astronomical
explanation, Gill replies that he does not know.

Gill tells McDonald that the sighting occurred some time ago (eight
years) and that he could not remember all the details of the sighting
including dates, however the events were clear in his mind.

Gill tells McDonald that the night of the apparent response, by the
humanoids, they waved with their torches, not expecting any response.
They also attempted, with the torches, unsuccessfully, to indicate to
the UFO, to land.

Gill explained that, at one time, there were four glowing humanoid
figures on the top of the UFO for a considerable length of time. The
humanoids had a, 'Sparkle effect,' that appeared to trace the outline of
their bodies. The effect resulted in a type of halo, six to nine inches
(15 to 23 cm) wide around their bodies and followed their movements. The
central figure appeared to be doing something and one appeared to be
looking at the witnesses on the ground. They appeared to be coming and
going from the, 'Deck,' of the UFO.

On the following day, Gill and others, measured with a tape, on the
field, a distance of 350 feet (105 metres), to where the UFO had been
stationary in the sky.

McDonald asked Gill about the people who witnessed the sighting, Gill
said that they were educated and partially educated natives, including a
local named Steven Moi. There was also a teacher at another location who
described a, 'Bright sixpence,' over the coastline with dots on it, on
the night of their sighting.

Gill explained that a person had seen a stationary glowing object over
Mount Nueva like a, 'Pressure lamp,' but none with what appeared to be
humanoids. There was a glow reported by a trader on the same night as
their sighting, the trader asked Gill if he had seen it.

There was also a report from a Government Patrol Officer who saw a
bright light on the same night as their sighting. Gill said that the
Patrol Office would not back up his sighting for fear of losing his job.

Gill claimed that he had been trying to find an explanation for his
sighting and had read a few books on UFOs following this sighting. He
decided that he was getting nowhere and tried to put it out of his mind,
since it was turning into a futile academic and physiological exercise.

Gill mentioned that he had been interviewed by the <i>Post</i> Magazine and
the <i>Brisbane Courier Mail Newspaper.</i>

Gill said that he is teaching History and English at Camberwell Grammar
School, in Victoria, Australia and is the Junior School Chaplain. He
submitted his resignation from the mission in New Guinea in October 1959
and returned to Australia. He added that he has eight children and needs
a good income to provide for the family.

The report on the incident by Reverend Norman Crutwell was mentioned by
Gill and suggested that McDonald visit Crutwell in New Guinea. McDonald
claimed that his funds were limited and this would not permit him to
visit New Guinea.

Gill said that the, 'Men in Canberra,' said that his sighting could have
been a misinterpretation of the planets. Gill mentioned that they were
facing west on the night of the sightings, and that Venus had
disappeared from view before the sightings.

McDonald referred to a similar, 'Strange case,' that occurred in Kent,
Ohio, USA, a month and a half earlier. A 22 year old person was driving
a car and witnessed a lightning storm at 1.30 am. He then saw a cone
shaped object on the side of the road and four to five glowing figures
on the road. He thought he had hit one, he came to a stop and started to
get out of the car but changed his mind. He saw the figures on the road
behind the car as he departed. There was a dent in his car that could
have been caused by hitting one of the figures.

McDonald also mentioned the well documented Hopkinsville encounter
(1955) by a, 'Hill Billy family,' of small glowing creatures.

McDonald stated that, 'In the states there is still the same scoffing
among scientists,' about the UFO phenomena. McDonald said that he had
talked to staff at the Smithsonian Institute, Rand Corporation and
Douglas Aircraft and been impressed by their interest in the subject of
UFOs. McDonald was therefore hopeful of continued interest, and in his
opinion, all the evidence points to it being extra-terrestrial and,
'From somewhere else.'

McDonald mentions his research on the 1896/1897, 'Airships,' from all
over the USA that apparently displayed advanced technology, for the
time, such as, 'Search lights.' A similar wave of sightings occurred in
New Zealand in 1909. McDonald told Gill that this phenomenon has been
reported throughout history and,

'Is much older.'

McDonald told Gill of the 1959 Moreland sighting that occurred in New
Zealand. Mrs Moreland had been milking cows and saw a flying saucer like
object hover over the peach trees on her property. Two humanoid figures
could be seen inside the clear dome on the top of the saucer.

McDonald told Gill of the 1897 sighting in Leroy Kansas, USA by
Alexander Hamilton, where an object was seen with, 'Six of the most
hideous creatures looking down.' He added that National Investigations
Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) investigated this sighting

McDonald stated that, 'The problem is of enormous scope,' and that he
had not done any cloud physics research for the last year while he was
studying UFOs.

He added that he had talked to twenty scientific groups and had spoken
at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
(CSIRO) division of Radio Physics in Sydney yesterday, and is be
speaking at the University of Melbourne tomorrow.

McDonald said that, 'In my University the Astronomers are down on this,'
and 'These people have not looked at the facts.' McDonald added that,
'So I am doing everything I can to push this out in the open.'

Gill said that he walked 22 miles (35 kilometres) shortly after the
sightings to get the Bishops Secretary to document his report, this
journey took him 30 hours. Gill's thoughts at the time were, 'Let's get
this down,' in a report.

<i>Editor's note: This interview is predominately about Gill's famous 1959
UFO sightings and is interspersed with general discussion on subjects
completely unrelated to UFOs. Coincidently, this interview occurred
almost exactly eight years after Gill's sightings New Guinea.</i>

<i>Reverend William B Gill, who was an Anglican priest with a mission in
Boianai, Papua New Guinea, observed, with others, craft-like UFOs, one
with what appeared to be humanoid figures, on the evenings of the 26 and
27 June 1959. Approximately twenty-five people, including teachers and
medical technicians, also observed the phenomena. They 'signalled' to
the humanoids and received an apparent response. This was one of many
UFO sightings within a few weeks in New Guinea.</i>

<i>Gill documented the sightings with Reverend Norman Crutwell and
subsequently the Australian media obtained these reports. After the
reports were published, in August 1959, there was a media sensation,
particularly in Australia.</i>

<i>This interview confirms Gill as an impressive and articulate witness,
having a manner that lacks any perception or attempt of embellishment.</i>

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Brian Kibel (Part 1)

Sighting Date: 1956 (may have been 1953)

Sighting Time: Day

Location of Sighting: Near Kanangra Walls, near Oberon, New South Wales,
Australia

Duration of Sighting: 45 seconds

Witness(es): Brian Johnson Kibel; and four other unidentified people

Summary:

Brian Kibel was in a remote area near Kanangra Walls, near Oberon, New
South Wales. It was plateau country, where a road runs to an escarpment
with a 300 metre cliff descending to a valley floor.

It was an overcast and cold day, with a low cloud ceiling only 30 metres
above. He walked out to the edge of the escarpment and looked down to
the valley floor. Straight down was what appeared to be a silver water
tank on the valley floor. There was no road and trees were sparse. There
were two to three moving objects observed. They were moving around what
appeared to be the tank; 'Dots,' moving around.

Kibel walked back from the cliff edge, a distance of about 50 metres. He
then heard a slight humming sound, like a dynamo running at medium
pitch. As he turned around to face the cliff edge, he saw an object,
rising from the valley to up above the edge of the cliff. It appeared to
be six metres from the edge of the cliff and 50 metres from where he was
standing. It was rising at a speed he estimated to be 30 km per hour.

The object looked like it had a satin like, stainless steel surface
finish. In shape, it was like a squashed upside down light bulb with the
socket facing the ground. It was inclined at a slight angle with
vertical slots in a collar around the base. It came directly at him and
he ran away, it then passed over him at about ten metres altitude. He
was able at this point to get see the details of the underside of the
object. He was then running for his life, and went into a bush to hide.
He was able to look up into a hollow collar beneath the object and
noticed a tube-like structure inside, he saw what looked like an
inverted cup.

The object went on climbing and when it was about 80 metres away it
moved into the clouds. The humming noise then diminished. When it passed
over him there was no downdraft effect. He also noticed that there were
three balls on the bottom of the object. He sketched this for James
McDonald. He estimated size of the object to be 15 x 7 metres.

Features that Kibel noticed on the object; slight bump on top; metallic
appearance; straight line surface feature; appeared to be seamless and
two vertical lines around the base.

Later, in about 1962, Peter Norris from the Victorian Flying Saucer
Research Society (VFSRS) did a recorded interview with Kibel.

Kibel had been about 17 or 18 years old at the time of the sighting.

Brian's address, at the time was, Flat 1/115 New South Head Road,
Vaucluse, Sydney, New South Wales.

There were four others present who witnessed the object; a clergyman and
three ladies from Sydney. They told Brian that they had seen it rise
from the valley floor. They had been about 150 metres from him. Brian
did not get their names. All the witnesses sketched the object.

The duration of the event had been about 45 seconds. The object had been
going into the wind and the wind had been blowing in his face.

Interview Duration (m:s): 6:27

Interview Details: James McDonald's comments on the meeting at the
Anderson house, Melbourne, Australia

Summary:

McDonald states that this recording is about the evening of interviews
at the Anderson house.

McDonald comments that Peter Norris and Jim Kibel have informed him that
the number of UFO sightings in South Australia is very high. Colin
Norris indicated that the per capita rate is higher in South Australia
than any other state in Australia.

McDonald said he talked about the, 'Cover-up, versus foul-up,
hypothesis,' with Kibel and Norris. McDonald thought that there must be
some, 'Serious analysis of the problem,' in the Royal Australian
Airforce (RAAF). Apparently, McDonald was told that unidentified people
were shown albums of high quality UFO photographs, that were, 'Of
outstanding interest,' to the RAAF.

At the Anderson house, Jim Kibel had, 'Guardedly,' informed McDonald
that there was a lot more evidence and that Kibel, 'Intimated that there
must be some recognition of the dimensions of the problem within the
RAAF.'

McDonald thought that there was a possibility that the RAAF are ahead of
the US Airforce on UFO investigations, he commented that the RAAF appear
to have taken a more serious approach. McDonald suggested that the RAAF
may be, 'Puzzled by the American Airforce's stand on it,' and knowing
that there is, 'Something more to it,' they could be, 'Stood off by the
American Airforce's position.'

McDonald said he spoke to the group at the Anderson house for half an
hour after he first talked to Reverend William Gill.

Jim Kibel took McDonald, 'Aside,' and suggested that he and McDonald
could, 'Talk confidentially about some aspects to the problem.' McDonald
thoughts were, 'Not sure what he had in mind.' McDonald thought that
Kibel was guarded because he is in the Civil Defence and has
obligations. Jim Kibel said to McDonald that he did not want his name
mentioned to the public, and that Brian Kibel did not have any such
reservations on being identified.

McDonald stated that they had organised, 'When and if,' to meet up with
Jim Kibel and visit the site where Jim Kibel photographed a UFO at the,
'Balwyn site.' McDonald commented that, 'This seems like a very
interesting one indeed,' referring to Jim Kibel's sighting.

<i>Editor's note: The recording is a summary by McDonald, of the meeting
at the Anderson house. It is apparent from the McDonald's dialogue,
that, Peter Norris, Reverend William Gill, Jim Kibel and Brian Kibel
were at the residence. There is likely to have been others including the
Anderson family.</i>

<i>The claim that the frequency of UFO sightings, in South Australia,
being above that reported in other states of Australia is speculation.</i>

<i>Apparently, Jim Kibel gave the impression that he had more information
on UFOs that he was willing to disclose, confidentially, with McDonald.</i>

#  Interviews John Mc Cuckey 

Identification Code/CD Number: 3T11S203/CD 45

Date Recorded: 29 June 1967 at Chelsea, Victoria, Australia

File Size: 15.1 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 16:30

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews John Mc Cuckey

Sighting Date: 10 April 1966 (Easter Monday)

Sighting Time: 11.30 am

Location of Sighting: Near Mount Cathedral, Taggerty, Victoria,
Australia

Duration of Sighting: 20 minutes

Witness(es): John Mc Cuckey, Douglas Kent and others

Summary:

John Mc Cuckey explained his sighting to McDonald. Fourteen people
including friends and relatives were on holidays with Mc Cuckley, when
two airborne objects were witnessed at 11.30 am, by Douglas Kent.
Commercial jets were also seen traversing the sky throughout the day.
The objects were near Mount Cathedral that is close to the town of
Taggerty.

The objects were some distance away and the sky was clear and without
clouds.

Mc Cuckey's first impression was that they were two weather balloons.
When Mc Cuckey viewed the objects with binoculars he could see that they
were spherical. He described a tail on each sphere as, 'Looking
something like a shuttlecock,' and appeared to be, 'Feathery.' The
metallic surface finish on the spheres was described as like an,
'Aluminium substance.' There were no markings on the objects.
Apparently, the tails were not always visible. The objects were
stationary for about 20 minutes, then one sphere disappeared at high
speed, in a westerly direction and was lost from sight in a few seconds.

Mc Cuckey then said to McDonald that they went for lunch at about 12.15
pm, the remaining stationary object was still in the sky. They had been
watching the objects for 20 minutes before lunch. When they returned
from lunch the remaining object could not be seen, and obviously had
moved away.

McDonald questioned Mc Cuckey for additional details, and he said that
he was having difficulty remembering. Mc Cuckey estimated that when the
two objects were visible they would have been six diameters apart and
located at an elevation of 45 degrees. He added that the tails were
one-third of the diameter long and it was easy to lose sight of the
objects without using binoculars.

Australia File Size: 22.5 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 22:51

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Kerry Smith

Sighting Date: 30 March 1967

Sighting Time: 8.30 pm

Location of Sighting: Four and a half miles (seven kilometres) north
east of Peterborough, South Australia

Duration of Sighting: Approximately five seconds (first encounter)

Witness(es): Kerry Smith and his brother Adrian

Summary:

Peter Norris organised for McDonald to speak to Kerry Smith by phone.
The interview between McDonald and Smith was recorded while they were
speaking on the telephone.

There were several UFO sightings reported during the interview.

The first sighting occurred on or near the 30 March 1967 while Kerry
Smith and his brother were driving their <i>Holden</i> car approximately four
and a half miles (seven kilometres) north-east from Peterborough. The
car lost power at 8.30 pm and stopped. When they got out of the car to
open the bonnet they noticed a sphere located 100 feet (30 metres) away
in a paddock. The sphere went straight up and disappeared in seconds, it
had what appeared to be a, 'Purple and blueish,' exhaust gas and no
lights. After the sphere disappeared the engine on the car could be
started.

They continued in the car and shot a rabbit and noticed a light in a
creek bed, it was described as looking like a, 'Fluorescent light.' The
light was about 100 yards (90 metres) away. The light was eight to
twelve feet (two to four metres) off the ground and had a, 'Strong
blueish cast.' The size of the light was estimated to be 100 feet (30
metres) long and five to eight feet (two metres) high. They observed the
light for about 30 seconds and left.

During the return trip, they noticed another airborne object like a disc
15 to 20 feet (six metres) in diameter that had an exhaust of various
colours. The car engine did not stop this time. The next day Smith
returned to the site but could find no evidence of a landing site.

Smith reported that another person, named Bob, had an incident where his
car stopped unexpectedly at Peterborough in the same week as their
encounter.

Other reports of encounters with UFOs causing vehicles to malfunction
were reported by Smith, however the descriptions were confusing to
follow.

<i>Editor's note: Kerry Smith's interview was confusing since the
chronology and details of the sightings were not clearly distinguished.
Consequently, McDonald had difficulty following the details of the
sightings, while at the same time trying to make notes.</i>

<i>There is a reference to this sighting, dated 30 March 1967, in the
Australian Flying Saucer Review (AFSR) ^\[1\]^, a Royal Australian
Airforce (RAAF) file ^\[2\]^ and an UFO Research (South Australia)
Incorporated report (not cited).</i>

<i>There is also a report in a RAAF file ^\[3\]^ relating to a UFO
sighting at Peterborough on the 3 April 1967, by Mr Pratt. This report
may be unrelated to the sighting in this summary.</i>

Identification Code/CD Number 3T12S1203/CD46

Date Recorded: 30 June 1967

File Size: 32.1 MB

Interview Duration: (m:s): 33:25

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Adrian Van der Brink

Sighting Date: Could be the 8 or 9 May, the year was not identified in
the audio recording

Sighting Time: 9.55 pm Central Standard Time (CST)

Location of Sighting: About 20 miles (32 km) south of Woomera, South
Australia, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Ten seconds

Witness(es): Adrian Van der Brink

Summary:

Adrian was driving towards Woomera. At a location about 23 miles (37 km)
south of Woomera, there is an area on the road where you can see the
lights on a collimation tower, at Island Lagoon. This tower is
illuminated with red and white lights.

Shortly after he saw an object between the tower and the line of the
road. The object was to the left of the road. When the tower become
visible he had slowed his vehicle to about 10 mph (15 km/hr). At this
point an unusual light appeared on the horizon, rose vertically and then
foreshortened. The light was like a fluorescent tube.

He had to bend down in his seat to keep the phenomenon visible through
the front windscreen of this car. When it foreshortened it appeared to
have stopped moving. It then shrank to a dot, and vanished. The total
time for the observation was estimated to have been ten seconds.

His immediate thought, and indeed his thought at the interview, was that
it had been a rocket launch from Woomera. The azimuth of the sighting
from the place where he was, would have been in line with one of the
firing ranges. However, Van der Brink stated that he had checked with a
technician at Woomera, who advised him that there had been no launches
at that time.

He had the impression that the light, which was blue/white in colour,
became smaller, because it was receding. In angular size, its width,
compared to the Moon may have been three minutes of arc. He estimated
its length, as equal to that of a cigarette held at arm's length. It had
a very steady motion and the angular elevation of the final dot, was
estimated to be 45 degrees.

He was certain it had been a rocket launch, but no rockets had been
launched at that time from Woomera.

Identification Code/CD Number: 3T12S204/CD47

Date Recorded: 1 July 1967

File Size: 23.2 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 25:24

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews John Coyle and his sister
regarding their photograph of a UFO. The second part of the audio is
recorded in a car with other persons on an unidentified day, obviously
after the 1 July 1967.

Sighting Date: 5 March 1967

Sighting Time: 5.30 to 5.45 pm

Location of Sighting: Melbourne, Australia, exact location not
identified

Duration of Sighting: Not identified in audio recording

Witness(es): John Coyle (age 15) and his sister Miriam Coyle (age 13)

Summary:

McDonald asks questions to John Coyle and his sister, at their
residence, regarding a UFO sighting that they witnessed and
photographed. The sighting occurred in a paddock, about three quarters
of a mile from their house (1.2 km). During the interview, McDonald was
looking at the set of photographs.

Six photographs were taken of the UFO with an <i>Anny</i> analogue camera
(Japanese manufacture). John explained that he purchased the camera in
1966, after being asked by McDonald. The reason for using the camera
that day was that John wanted to use the remaining film in the camera
before having the film winding mechanism repaired.

John and his sister, Miriam, were walking across a local paddock that
was located about three quarters of a mile (1.2 km) from the train
tracks. They were returning from filming trains when Miriam observed an
object in the sky. Their distance from the object is not identified in
the audio recording. They took six photographs, in quick succession, of
the unidentified object. The order that they were taken was not known by
them.

McDonald asked if John had the negatives, he replied, 'Yes.' McDonald
said that the order that the photographs were taken could be determined
from the shape of the cut edges on the negatives. McDonald suggested
that they try to reassemble the negatives to determine the order in
which they were taken.

The audio recording then jumps to what sounds like being in a car, John
and Miriam are present, it is raining. McDonald had apparently driven a
car to the location where the sighting had occurred. McDonald was using
the images as a reference while trying to locate the exact location of
the sighting. Comments relating to the possible locations in the paddock
are heard while they are in the car. McDonald could not confirm the
location, with certainty, using the trees in the photograph as a
reference. There was joking and discussion in the car and it was obvious
that McDonald was prepared to go out into the rain to get a better view.
It is not confirmed if they could identify the exact sighting location.

The recording jumps to another day and McDonald is in a car with
unidentified persons in Victoria. One of the others has an obvious
American sounding accent. They were talking about various local
sightings, the Moe and Taggerty, Victoria sightings were mentioned,
including other sightings. They were also talking about power generation
and the open cut coal mine at the Morwell Power Station in Victoria,
possibly referring to a UFO sighting at this location.

McDonald mentioned the flying disc that was photographed, in Brazil, and
the investigation of the photograph by Phil Hardman. McDonald said that
there were, 'Suspicious features about the light and shadow pattern on
that set of photos; they don't seem to match.' McDonald made the comment
that there were five photographs in the series that were taken in
Brazil.

McDonald made the criticism that images were published,
'Indiscriminately,' in the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO)
Bulletin.

<i>Editor's note: The unidentified person with the American accent in the
car with McDonald is Paul Norman, who is a member of the Victorian
Flying Saucer Research Society (VFSRS). Apparently, Paul hosted
McDonald's visit to Australia in 1967.</i>

<i>James McDonald comments on this case, in the audio recording,

File Size: 33.0 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 34:25

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Charles Brew

Sighting Date: Not stated during the interview. Known by editor to be
the 15 February 1963 Sighting Time: 7 am

Location of Sighting: Moe, Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: 15 to 16 seconds

Witness(es): Charles Brew, and his son Trevor, who heard the sound but
did not see the object

Summary:

This recording was made on Brew's property. The recording starts with
McDonald apparently consulting a sketch and referring to a, 'Rocky
outcrop,' on the property. Brew then indicates the location of the
outcrop. He comments that the object appeared on an overcast, and
raining morning when he and his son were milking the cows. The cloud
base was low.

Brew looked out of the shed when he saw an object coming out of the
heavy cloud. He commented to his son that it looked like a flying
saucer. It moved across the sky and then hovered just above a large
tree, at an estimated height of 40 feet (12 metres), for a period of
eight to ten seconds, then went off to the west into the clouds and was
lost from view. The duration of the sighting was estimated to be 15 to
16 seconds. He estimated that the distance to the tree, above which it
had hovered, was 75 to 80 yards (70 to 75 metres).

The time of the sighting was about 7 am. There were no lights on the
object and it was not glowing. There was a, 'Whirring noise.' When it
took off it made a different noise, that Brew and his son said sounded
like, 'A lump of wood being swung around in the breeze.' There was
discussion about exactly what this sounded like, and reference made to
the sound made by an, Aboriginal Didgeridoo, it is unclear from the
interview if Brew and his son agreed on the sound comparison.

Brew stated that his cows were affected by the object. Half of the cows
started off in one direction, the rest went the other way. He said that
the cows responded about five to six seconds after he first saw the
object.

McDonald asked about the cows being affected, and Brew said that there
were 40 cows milked, ten in the stall, and 30 waiting in a yard to be
milked. It was the first batch of 40 cows that had run off, to the
north. There had been a ten percent drop off in milk production in the
week following the sighting.

The object, when hovering, had been at tree top height and then shot
off. His son, Trevor had heard the sound. When the object was hovering,
he noted that its underneath was slowly rotating. He described the
object as being like a coloured, toy spinning top, but slightly flatter.

McDonald then spoke to the son about the noise. He said it was not like
an engine, but like a ruler in the wind. There was discussion about what
this sounded like, Trevor said it was difficult to describe accurately.
Brew said that around the bottom of the object there were something like
holes, little hooks or scoops. It was turning slowly. Asked to estimate
its rate of rotation, he guessed about one revolution per second. It was
revolving anti-clockwise, as seen from his location. The object took off
at a steep angle, it had also descended at a steep angle, out of the
clouds.

He said that for the rest of the day, and most of the next day, he had a
headache. There were no other physiological effects. Trevor did not get
a headache.

There were no other known witnesses. Jack Williams was their nearest
neighbour.

Asked about other sightings, he said that Len Roswell at Willow Grove,
three years previously, had seen an object while he was carting hay, in
the western sky. The object appeared big and long, shaped like a,
'German sausage.'

Brew revealed that he thought he may have seen two humanoid figures in
the top, transparent area of the object. He was not sure about this, and
therefore he did not mention this until McDonald asked if there were any
other points about the sighting which he wished to mention. He said this
was something like the sighting by a Mrs Moreland in New Zealand. Brew
revealed that about six months after his sighting, Mrs Moreland had
written to him

Asked about any other sighting, Brew stated that a friend of his, Ron
Dent, had seen a flying saucer.

Research Society (VFSRS), interviews witnesses of a UFO sighting

Sighting Date: 12 June 1964

Sighting Time: 5.55 pm

Location of Sighting: Hallam, Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Approximately ten minutes

Witness(es): Robert Preston, Janette Stevenson, Dorothy Merford and
another unidentified person.

Summary:

This audio tape recording by Geoff Rumpf was re-recorded by McDonald.

On the 12 June 1964 Robert Preston (19 years old) was driving a car with
the Jannette Stevenson (17 years old) and Dorothy Merford (17 years
old). They were travelling from Dandenong to Belgrave South when they
witnessed an object in the sky at 5.55 pm. An unidentified friend was
travelling behind them in another car, this person also saw the object.
Robert was identified by Rumpf, as residing at Hallam Road, South
Belgrave.

Rumpf asked Robert, who was in the first car, where the sighting
occurred, Robert stated that he was driving along Hallam Road, in the
centre of Hallam, when he, 'First noticed it.' Robert stated that his
passenger, Jannette Stevenson saw the object first. He pulled over to
the side of the road to get a better view of the object.

Robert explained to Rumpf that the object appeared to be hovering, at
approximately, an angle of forty degrees, relative to ground level. They
watched the object for ten minutes when, 'All of a sudden, it took off
at great speed.' The object was described, by Robert as travelling
south, towards Melbourne and being flat. Robert said that it 'Looked
like a coin turned on its end,' with 'An extremely brilliant light on
the front of it,' and, 'A pale yellowish/white one on the rear.' Robert
explained, after being asked by Rumpf, that the lights did not change
colour and there was no associated interference with the car ignition or
radio. No noise could be heard coming from the object.

The person in the car that was following only noticed the light in the
sky.

Rumpf confirmed that Robert had not been contacted by the Government or
Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) about this sighting.

On the following day Rumpf interviewed Janette Stevenson, who was the
first person to see the object. Janette was identified as residing at
Emerald Road, Narre Warren North, Victoria. She explained that they were
almost at the corner of Hallam Road, Hallam when she noticed a red light
in the sky. Janette explained that the light appeared to be glowing more
than any other star, and that it appeared to be stationary. After she
drew Robert's attention to the object, he pulled over to the side of the
road and stopped the car. Janette then lowered the car window to get a
better view. She estimated the object was as big as a plane, noiseless
and located approximately half a mile away (800 metres).

She could not see the shape of the object. Then the object, after
appearing to be stationary, moved in front of the car and went in a
westerly direction, towards Melbourne.

Rumpf confirmed that Janette had correctly reported the trajectory of
the object, Robert reported, incorrectly, that he first saw the object
in an easterly direction. Rumpf said that in the sighting report,
Janette identified the object as being slightly dome shaped on top.
Rumpf identified the other witness in the car with Robert and Janette as
Dorothy Merford (age 17) who resided in Courtneys Road, South Belgrave,

Victoria. The car following behind passed the first car when it stopped,
and then continued without stopping.

his UFO sighting Sighting Date: 12 June 1964

Sighting Time: 6.30 pm

Location of Sighting: Hallam, Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Estimated to be seven minutes

Witness(es): Robert Preston, Janette Stevenson and two other
unidentified passengers in the car

Summary:

On the 12 June 1064, Robert Preston was driving his car north on Hallam
Road, Hallam when he noticed a bright orange light in the sky. The time
was approximately 6.30 pm and it was on dusk. He had three passengers in
the car. Robert was returning home to South Belgrave. The bright orange
light was described as, 'In the westerly direction above us,' and on the
eastern side of the car.

Robert said that he saw the light first then one of the other passengers
noticed the light. Robert claimed that the light was so bright that they
stopped the car in Hallam Road, Hallam and got out to get a better view,
at this stage it appeared to be stationary. They could not see any stars
because of the twilight, there were no clouds. The light was bigger and
brighter than a star.

McDonald asked Robert what was the relative angular size of the light
and he replied about twice the size of the moon. The light/object was
described as having a dim white light on the front and an orange light
on the rear. The object was estimated to be elevated at twenty degrees
relative to ground level and approximately 800 feet (240 metres) from
Robert.

After getting out of the car they watched the object for two to three
minutes then, 'All of a sudden, it took off,' in a westerly direction.
The lights did not change in colour or intensity during the
acceleration. The object stopped again after travelling about a mile
(two kilometres) and then took off over the horizon towards Melbourne.
The completed sighting lasted for five to seven minutes.

When driving along the Princes Highway, Robert first noticed the light
and thought it was a <i>Shell</i> service station sign. When they turned into
Hallam Road, Hallam it became obvious that the light was in the sky.
Then Janette who was one of the passengers in the car noticed the light
and pointed it to the others.

No structure could be observed where the lights were located. And at no
time could they hear any sound associated with the object.

Robert mentioned another sighting he had witnessed; this was described
as like a bright star that moved in the sky.

Robert told McDonald that he did not report the sighting at Hallam to
the Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF). He finally added that the local
newspaper in Belgrave published an editorial on the sighting and that
the artists drawing was incorrect since it showed the object as cigar
like, in shape.

0.30 am File Size: 8.20 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 8:57

Interview Details: Geoff Rumpf interviews RV Pollard regarding his UFO
sighting

Sighting Date: 10 July 1964

Sighting Time: 3.15 am

Location of Sighting: Tintinara, South Australia

Duration of Sighting: A few minutes

Witness(es): Mr Pollard and four others that were not unidentified

Summary:

This audio tape recording was copied by McDonald on the 3 July 1967 from
Rumpf's recording of the interview with Mr Pollard. Mr Pollard was
identified by Rumpf as residing at Breakwater Road, East Geelong,
Victoria, Australia.

Mr Pollard had been returning to Victoria, by car, after a trip to South
Australia on the 10 July 1964. At a location, approximately three miles
(five km) past Tintinara, on the Adelaide side of the highway one of the
passengers noticed a light behind the car at 3.15 am. Pollard commented
that, 'There was something coming down the road towards the car at a
height of 50 feet (15 metres).'

By this time, the others in the car were alerted to the presence of the
light. They could see an object, that was, 'Cylindrical in shape and
bluish in colour.'

As the object go closer to the car they could see on the cylinder, 'Two
little lights approximately eight feet (two metres) apart.' The cylinder
was described by Pollard as being saucer shaped, when it got closer.

The night was described as dark and windy. There were five people in the
car, including Mr Pollard. The height of the object was described as
just above the highway light pole wires and therefore approximately 30
feet (nine metres) high.

The object approached from the left side of the car and followed the
road up to the car, then proceeded directly over the car, before they
stopped the car. Pollard then stopped the car, and they all got out to
find that the object could not be seen. There was also no sound that may
indicate the presence of the object. There was no interference with the
car's ignition during the encounter, the car did not have a radio, so
radio interference could not be confirmed.

Pollard described the object as being saucer shaped, with what appeared
to be two windows or portholes. A yellowish colour could be seen through
the portholes. The saucer was estimated to be 12 to 15 feet (four to
five metres) in diameter. The surface finish appeared to be metallic,
without protuberances.

The object was first noticed coming from over the trees on the side of
the road 50 yards (45 metres) behind the car.

The flight characteristics of the object were described by Pollard as
like, 'Gliding.' Pollard immediately stopped the car when the object
moved over the car. Their initial thoughts were that the object may have
been a helicopter but they thought this was unlikely as they had heard
nothing.

After they stopped the car and got out they started to feel scared and
returned to the car and proceed driving back to Victoria.

The size of the, 'Portholes,' on the object were described by Pollard as
being twelve by eight inches (300 to 200 mm). The light emanating from
the portholes was described as, 'Quite yellowish, similar to a fog light
on a motor car.' The object had no illumination or glow except for the
two lights.

<i>Editor's note: During the dialogue Rumpf refers to Pollard having the
initials VR before his surname. Therefore, his name may be VR Pollard
instead of RV Pollard as identified by McDonald.</i>

sighting

Sighting Date: 4 March (year not identified in audio recording, likely
to be between 1964 and 1967) Sighting Time: 3 am

Location of Sighting: Near Avalon, Victoria, Australia Duration of
Sighting: Between one and two hours

Witness(es): Lloyd Baker and an unidentified person

Summary:

This audio recording between Rumpf and Baker is a re-recording by
McDonald.

Lloyd Baker was approaching, in a car, the turn off to Werribee, a few
miles (three kilometres) past Avalon when he first noticed a light, seen
through trees. Lloyd's initial thoughts were that the light was a Royal
Australian Airforce (RAAF) pylon light. Lloyd's described why his
attention was drawn to the light, 'I have never seen a light like it,
was such a huge light.' The time was, 'Just after,' 3 am and there were
a few stars visible in the dark sky.

The light was described, by Lloyd, as large and bright, 'Like looking
into a search light, at very close range,' and having a 'Molten
appearance.' There appeared to be two lights.

Lloyd was driving to Melbourne and the light was behind his car, and he
was turning frequently, trying to identify the source of the light

The light appeared to be stationary, then started to, 'Rise very rapidly
into the sky,' going east, towards Melbourne, then south east and,
'Skirted,' Melbourne. Following this the light moved east over the
Dandenong ranges, the light then appeared to be stationary again.

The light was described as easy to see and a, 'Well defined object.' The
appearance was described as, 'More like an apple with what appeared to
be antenna, from the top, where the stalk would normally be, five of
these antenna, the main one, with four others, branching off.'

Lloyd continued with the description of the object, in detail, 'The two
top ones were slightly bent,' with further description, 'The one on the
right-hand side was petal shaped with a spooning effect towards the
end,' and, 'The two at the base, one was a stubby one, that was on the
right-hand side.' He added, 'The one on the left-hand side was twice as
long, possibly three times as long, and glowed a reddish colour.' The
glow was described as intermittent, 'Like a stick taken out of a fire at
night time.'

Additionally, the object had what looked like a, 'Hatchway,' and this
was, 'Distinctly visible.'

Lloyd said that when the object got to the Dandenong Ranges it appeared
smaller but still quite visible, appearing to be the size of a cricket
ball and that the antennas were visible.

While over the Dandenong's the object, 'Emitted, from the hatchway a
pinkish type bubble,' this bubble grew to the size of the object, then
after a few seconds, disappeared.

When the object was in flight it appeared to be surrounded by an
elliptical belt of white light, described by Lloyd as, 'Like snow on a
television screen,' and he added that, 'This belt of light was not as
bright as the object.'

No sound was heard from the object, although it may have been too far
away to confirm.

The object was described as larger than any conventional aircraft and,
'As large a city building.'

When Lloyd first sighted the object, it may have been 100 to 150 feet
(30 to 45 metres) off the ground, and no more than a mile (approximately
two kilometres) high, at any stage.

Lloyd was so excited he stopped his car at, South Box Hill, and asked a
butcher to come out of his shop to witness and confirm the sighting.
Lloyd said that the butcher stated, 'That he never thought he would live
to see anything like it.'

Lloyd noticed an aircraft in the sky at the time. The aircraft was
located a few miles (three kilometres) on the Laverton side of
Melbourne, he added that the aircraft may have been military and
appeared to be heading in the direction of the object.

Lloyd said that others, on his behalf, contacted the RAAF about this
sighting. The RAAF said that they had no knowledge of any unusual
sightings that night.

Lloyd stated his occupation as a journalist.

Duration of Sighting: Several minutes

Witness(es): John Coyle (age 15) and his Miriam (age 13)

Summary:

McDonald comments about the Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society
(VFSRS) report on the sighting by John and Miriam Coyle. McDonald is at
the Southern Cross Hotel, in Melbourne.

John and Miriam are identified as residing at, 27 Alexander Street,
Hallam, Victoria.

At about 5.30 pm they were heading across a paddock towards old Hallam
school when Miriam saw, 'What she first thought was a fast aircraft.'
John thought that the object was a UFO and started taking photographs of
the object. The object was moving around them in a circle for a period
of two and a half minutes.

McDonald commented that John purchased the camera at <i>Coles,</i> for 95
cents or a dollar.

The UFO was described as, 'Circling around at almost stalling speed,'
and would have crashed if it was an aircraft.

The object was described as making no sound, silver in colour and shaped
like a disc. The weather was cloudy and cold.

The object was below the cloud level and had a relative size, equivalent
to, a five cent piece held at arm's length.

There were no trees in the paddock therefore the comparative height of
the object could not be estimated.

McDonald said that John turned 15 years old on the 24 January 1967,
Miriam was 13 years old.

John thought that the object was a UFO, however Miriam, did not believe
in the existence of UFOs and therefore doubted John's claim.

McDonald said that Miriam described the object as, 'Looked like a silver
disc with a slight rise on the top.'

The object was moving in circles around John and Miriam, each orbit took
about two and a half minutes. Following several orbits the object slowed
down, moved closer to them and then moved away, to the west and over the
horizon.

Mrs Coyle who was John and Miriam's mother, said that John came home
very excited after the sighting.

McDonald stated that he said, 'Mum we saw a flying saucer.'

The black and white film from John's camera was taken to the Mc Kean's
Pharmacy, at Dandenong for development into photographs. The head of the
camera department at the Pharmacy was Mr Williams.

The UFO sighting occurred on the 16 August 1965 when Francis Pearman
observed a light from her property at Warburton. The sighting occurred
at between six and seven at night. The sky was free of clouds.

Francis was taking the dog outside, as she did most nights, when she
noticed a light, described by her as, 'I've never seen a light like that
one,' and, 'A most peculiar light.' When being asked by McDonald to
precisely describe the light she had difficulty putting this into words.
McDonald said, to assist with the description of the light, 'Light was
coming out through a shell or covering,' she agreed that this was a
suitable analogy.

The shape of the UFO was described by Francis as, 'Flattish saucer shape
thing,' and having a slightly raised section on top. He also said that
the light was a, 'Twinkling kind of light,' and that, 'The whole thing
radiated this light.' McDonald said that the colour of the light was
yellowish/red.

The location of the UFO appeared to be in the valley viewed from the
back of her house. The UFO appeared to be hovering at tree top height
during the six to seven minute observation, and then vanished from view.
The size of the UFO appeared to be the size of a full moon.

Francis was certain that the UFO was not an aircraft and it was close
enough to confirm that it was not a helicopter. The distance to the UFO
was estimated to be two to three miles (three to five kilometres).

Francis claimed that her neighbours were sceptical of her sighting.

A person from the local paper interviewed Francis about this sighting,
and that she was informed that there was another report of a light being
sighted in Wandin, at noon, on the same day.

McDonald asked Francis to sketch the UFO and then they went outside the
house to view where the UFO had been seen.

# James McDonald nterviews Kit Francis Williams 

Identification Code/CD Number: 3T16S1/CD51

Date Recorded: 10 pm on 3 July 1967 at Southern Cross Hotel, Melbourne

File Size: 53.7 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 58:42

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Kit Francis Williams
regarding his sighting during a World War 2, Lancaster bomber flight
over Germany

Sighting Date: 25 April 1945

Sighting Time: 9.45 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)

Location of Sighting: Near Kaiserslautern, Germany

Duration of Sighting: Probably a second

Witness(es): Kit Francis Williams (pilot) witnessed the sighting of a
UFO. There were six other flight crew in the Lancaster during the
incident.

Summary:

At the time of the sighting Kit Francis Williams was an Acting Squadron
Leader in the Royal Airforce (RAF), England. Kit was in the 617 Bomber
Squadron based at Woodall Spa, East Lincolnshire, England.

The sighting occurred on the 25 April 1945 while on a bombing mission
for Bomber Command's Special Duties Squadron. Kit was the pilot of the
<i>Avro Lancaster</i> bomber, that was in the position of the wing finder toe
in the flight group. This was the final bombing mission in Germany by
the RAF in the Second World War. The mission comprised 25 to 26
aircraft, and had been tasked to bomb, 'Hitler's hideout,
Berchtesgaden.'

The UFO incident occurred at 9.45 GMT just after a turn near
Kaiserslautern, Germany on the final approach to Berchtesgaden. The
<i>Lancaster</i> was at an altitude of 16,500 feet (5030 metres), the sky was
clear below and the there was a solid cloud cover at 18,500 feet (5640
metres). The nearest aircraft would have been two miles (three
kilometres) to the port. The main bomber group, referred to as the,
'Gaggle' would have been ten to fifteen miles (16 to 24 kilometres)
behind.

Kit, who was the pilot, witnessed, without warning, what he described
as, 'Like a great blanket, a woolly blanket,' that may have been four to
five miles wide (six to eight kilometres). Kit explained that it,
'Seemed to fill the whole of the windscreen,' of the aircraft and that
its colour was grey/brown like, 'An old army type blanket.'

The object appeared to be moving in the vertical direction past the
windscreen of the aircraft, and was gone,

'In an instant.'

Immediately following this sighting, the only bomb in the aircraft broke
loose, from its mounting, and, 'Crashed,' through the bomb bay door and
out of the aircraft. The bomb was a 12,000 pound (5443 kilograms) armour
piercing type, known as a, 'Tallboy.' Kit could hear and feel the
vibration of the bomb crashing through the bomb bay doors.

At the same time as the bomb loss, the electrical power in the aircraft
failed. This resulted in the four propeller engines losing power and
therefore the aircraft could not be properly trimmed from the lift
caused by the bomb's weight loss.

All four engine revolution counters started to drop and all other
electrically powered instruments ceased to function. Kit said during the
interview that it was, 'Obvious that my electrics had gone,' and they
were losing height.

The emergency action plan was commenced where the inboard port engine
was, 'Feathered,' the other three engines continued, 'Windmilling.' The,
'Feathered,' engine was locked in its starting position and then started
using the backup battery power system. The three other engines were
successfully started using the same technique, since, 'Windmilling,'
engines could not be started without first being, 'Feathered.' The
aircraft had dropped 4000 feet (1220 metres) to an altitude of 12,000
feet (3658 metres) due to the power loss.

At the same time as Kit was working on starting the first engine when
he, 'Thought he had hit his head on something,' and a, 'Sudden sensation
of a pounding headache,' this sensation continued.

Due to the damage caused by the detached bomb, the bomb bay door could
not be closed, apart from that there appeared to be no other damage to
the aircraft. The other aircraft in the group continued with their
bombing mission. Kit's aircraft returned to the base in England, since
they were now without a bomb.

An aircraft in the group apparently saw the bomb being dropped from
Kit's aircraft and its loss of altitude, they did not see anything else,
such as, the unidentified object seen by Kit.

Since the headache occurred, Kit was having difficulty getting his
reflexes working normally and having to think about an action before its
execution. Kit noticed that the Engineer and the Bomber appeared to be
having the same experience, of a headache. Kit commented that the
Bomber, 'Gave the impression that someone had walked up behind him, and
slapped him hard, between the shoulder blades,' adding that the Engineer
had the same expression. After taking to all the crew he confirmed that
they all had the same type of headache. The headaches were so
debilitating that they were all taking a variety of pain relief
medication that were in the emergency kits in the aircraft.

Because of the condition caused by the headache, Kit had not been able
to land the aircraft successfully and ran off the runway at the end, and
onto a grass verge.

After landing their <i>Lancaster</i> in England, an ambulance was waiting for
them.

At the time of the incident, Kit was 19 years old, the eldest of the
flight crew, the Navigator, was 26 years old.

Kit told McDonald that after landing the crew and himself were taken for
medical treatment and interrogation, over a period of eleven days. They
were first transferred to the base hospital then to Wokingham, England.
Following this, to the 'Guinea Pigs,' hospital at Rauceby RAF, where all
the medical specialists were located. They were finally moved to High
Wycombe, Bomber Command headquarters and then to the MI9 Enemy
Intelligence and Interrogation Centre. The medical treatment consisted
of various tests and the taking of medications to mitigate the headache,
none of these treatments were successful. Kit commented that he was in a
poor state of health because of the incident.

Kit said on the eleventh day is, 'When the headache dispersed.' Kit had
found out that all the air crew, except the rear gunner, had ceased
having headaches on the same day, within 12 hours of each other. The
Rear Gunner took three weeks for the headache to dissipate.

The seven crew in the <i>Lancaster</i> were all different physical builds,
and apparently that they were all equally affected by the headache. Kit
commented to McDonald that he suspected that the unidentified object had
caused the power loss in the aircraft, the headaches and loss of
physical co-ordination.

Kit explained to McDonald that he knew of a similar event that occurred
just after Christmas 1944 when a <i>Hawker Tempest</i>, piloted by John Dunk,
lost power over the English Channel. The pilot had bailed out of the
aircraft. Another similar event occurred in Nine Squadron during August
1944, when an aircraft lost power and the crew bailed out in the same
area as Kit had lost power.

Kit claimed that there were other bomber crews at High Wycombe Bomber
Command, at the same time he was there. He noticed that these crews were
taken to the same sections in the Command buildings and he therefore
speculated that they may have been there because they had similar
experiences while flying.

Kit witnesses one other sighting on the 1 January 1955 in the central
highlands of Malaysia. He, 'Was advised that there was a peculiar
aircraft flying around the area.' Therefore, he climbed, with others, at
'Frasers Hill,' to observe the unidentified object. He was the Field
Security Officer. He did not initially notice anything, but the Tamil
who had seen the object previously, climbed a tree to get a better view.
Kit said that the Tamil, 'Right out of the blue he started screaming has
head off,' and came down the tree to point, and he observed, 'There was
a puff, looked like a puff of green like smoke, like you would see from
a smoke bomb.' The, 'Puff,' was six to seven hundred feet (180 to 210
metres) above the tops of the mountains. As it expanded Kit took several
photographs until it dispersed over a period of six or seven minutes.
The colour of the, 'Puff,' was described by Kit as being, 'Bright sea
green.' Apparently, the Tamil has seen a flash of light before the,
'Puff.' At that time, he had the same feeling that the headache may
reoccur, like the one he had in 1945. This discomfort lasted for about
an hour and then dissipated. The Tamil had previously sighted the,
'Peculiar aircraft,' and described it as being like a flat shiny ball
and without any noise.

Kit told McDonald that he resided at, Ortolan Avenue, Broadmeadows,
Victoria. His telephone number was 309 2468.

Kit said that he had no lasting disability because of the incident in
1944. After leaving the hospital he commenced flying two weeks later
with a doctor and another pilot on board to access his ability for
flying. He later joined the Tiger Force, in Burma, and after that he
worked at London University. He went to Japan after their surrender, at
the end of the Second World War, and eventually moved to Australia.

When he had the second headache in 1955 he, 'Had the impression that one
was around,' referring to the unidentified object.

Kit thought, at the meetings with other air crew, that talk of UFO
activity is, 'Conspicuous by absence.' He also claimed that religious
people are not comfortable with discussing the reality of UFOs.

<i>Editor's note: This is a compelling report for several reasons. This
incident occurred before Kenneth Arnold's sighting of UFOs on the 24
June 1947, the first post War sighting in the USA and credited with
being the first of the modern era of UFO sightings. The other
significant aspect to this report is that the proximity of the UFO may
have caused the electrical failure in the Lancaster bomber, and the
consequential, identical physiological effects on all seven, flight
crew.</i>

<i>The Lancaster bomber normally had a crew of seven; the pilot, flight
engineer, navigator, wireless (radio) operator, bomb aimer/ front
gunner, mid-upper gunner, and rear gunner.</i>

<i>Hitler's mountain retreat and headquarters, known as the Berghof, was
in the Obersalzberg region, of the Bavarian Alps, Germany, near the town

Brighton, Victoria, Australia. File Size: 10.4 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 11:27

Interview Details: Judith Magee describes three UFO sightings

Sighting Date: The first occurred on 8 March 1962, no exact date was
known for the other sightings

Sighting Time: One sighting occurred at 6.45 pm, another at 9.30 pm and
no time was identified for the third sighting

Location of Sighting: The first sighting occurred at Brighton, Victoria,
Australia, the location of the other sightings was not identified

Duration of Sighting: First sighting was 15 to 20 minutes, no time was
identified for the other sightings Witness(es): Judith Magee

Summary:

Judith Magee was in her backyard on the 8 March 1962 when she noticed a
stationary light in the sky. The time was 6.45 pm, at sunset. Judith
initially thought the light may have been Venus, as it was the same
size, but excluded this, since the planets were in conjunction, and the
light was in the wrong position to be Venus.

She went inside the house and get the 12 x 50 binoculars. Judith
described the light, viewed through the binoculars, as having a, 'Saturn
shape,' that was only visible when viewed through the binoculars. Judith
said that the, 'Sun was casting a shadow on the top right hand side of
it, which gave the appearance of having a \[word inaudible\] or a ledge,
something like it.' The light was located sixty degrees above the
horizon. She viewed the motionless light for 15 to 20 minutes and went
inside the house. When she returned, five minutes later, the light was
gone.

Two other separate UFO sightings were described; the dates were unknown
but thought to be in 1962. Both

UFOs appeared to be spherical, tumbling and possibly moving as fast as
an aircraft. The UFOs emitted a, 'Swishing sound.' One of these
sightings was identified as occurring at about 9.30 pm.

The other UFO appeared near an aircraft that was on descent for landing.
Judith contacted the pilot of the aircraft by telephone, he said that he
did not see anything unusual during the landing.

McDonald makes the final comment, 'Does not sound like a meteor.'

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Dr V J Hajek regarding his
UFO sighting, via telephone Sighting Date: Thought to be 1952

Sighting Time: Between 11 am and noon

Location of Sighting: In vicinity of Lorne, Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: 12 seconds

Witness(es): Dr V J Hajek and his wife (name not identified)

Summary:

Dr V J Hajek and his wife were riding a motor bike on the road to Lorne.
His wife was riding as the pillion passenger. They had just crossed a
creek and heard a loud noise on their left-hand side, that sounded like
a, 'Landing jet plane.' Dr Hajek then said, 'I look to the left, where
the sound was coming from, there I saw this strange object.'

Dr Hajek braked the bike and stopped and he and his wife looked at the
object in the sky. The object was low on the horizon at an angle of
about 15 degrees to the horizon. He made the comment, 'As soon as I saw
it, I knew that it was something I had never seen before.'

The object had no wings, rudders or any other appendages and, 'Looked
like when you look though a fan.' The appearance was transparent and
ellipse like in shape. The course of the object was parallel with the
direction of the road they were on. The object was approximately a
quarter of a mile (400 metres) away and at about 200 feet (60 metres)
elevation.

The object was moving as fast as a jet and rising slowly, when it was
approximately one mile away (approximately two kilometres), 'It became
like a shining little rectangle.' The estimated size of the object was
30 feet (nine metres) long and five feet (150 cm) wide with a
metallic/silvery appearance. The thickness was described as, 'Like a
sheet of metal.'

The sunlight reflecting off the object surface confirming that it was
rotating on its horizontal axis. After 12 seconds the object faded from
view, being obscured as it moved in front of the direct sunlight.

The initial sound they heard lasted for a few seconds and died away as
the object moved further away.

There were no other witnesses.

# nterviews Ronald Sullivan 

Identification Code/CD: 3T16S204/CD52

Date Recorded: July 1967

File Size: 21.0 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 21:55

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Ronald F Sullivan

Sighting Date: 7 April 1966

Sighting Time: 8.30 pm

Location of Sighting: Maryborough to St Arnaud Road, Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Not stated during recording

Witness(es): Ronald F Sullivan

Summary:

Sullivan was driving long a bitumen road in a 1965 Ford Falcon sedan, at
approximately 60 mph (96 km/hr) speed. The sky was very clear. There was
no moonlight and there was a slight breeze. He first saw a light and
thought it was the rear lights of a tractor in a paddock. As he got
closer he saw a light, that lifted off the ground. This light had,
'Tubes of coloured lights.' These 'lights' were, 'All the colours of the
spectrum.' The tubular coloured lights were coming off it. There
appeared to be a, 'Disc or cone 10 to 15 feet (three to four and a half
metres) in diameter.' Each, 'Tube,' was four to five inches (10 to 13
cm) in diameter.

The police determined that the position of the object, in the paddock,
could have been 20 to 30 feet (six to nine metres) from the road, since
a depression was found in the paddock located at that distance from the
road. The, 'Disc,' was estimated to be 20 to 30 feet (six to nine
metres) above the ground, at one point.

The most unusual aspect was that this car's headlight beams, 'Bent,' to
the right, towards this light formation, 'As if they were magnetised.'

McDonald asked if Sullivan could see the beams of his headlight,
Sullivan said, 'Yes.' Questioning then lead to the suggestion that a
car, half a mile ahead (one km), and going in the same direction, as
Sullivan, was kicking up dust. This was suggested as the reason Sullivan
could see the beams of his headlight. The headlights of the car were
sealed in and could not independently move.

The police, Sargent Suttie from Maryborough, found a ground marking in
the paddock. A circular depression in the ground, four to five feet (10
to 13 cm) in diameter and seven to eight inches (18-20 cm) deep. These
measurements were smaller than what Sullivan would have estimated from
the size of the, 'Disc.' There were no human or animal markings around
the depression. The soil inside seemed to have been rippled in a
clockwise direction.

Sullivan noted no unusual noise above the noise of his vehicle. The
motor of his car was not affected, just the headlight beams appeared
bent. Responding to a question from McDonald about suffering any
physiological effects, Sullivan said, 'Only paralysis.' Further
questioning led him to say, 'A temporary mental paralysis.' He was not
frightened at the time, but hours later he queried what had happened.

At the time he had only told his wife about this event. However, when he
heard about the death of a motorist in that same spot, he told the
Police what he had seen. They went out with Sullivan to the spot and
found the depression in the paddock.

McDonald then questioned Ronald about the, 'Bent,' headlight beams.
Sullivan admitted it was difficult to properly describe what exactly
occurred to the headlights. The total duration of the effect to the
headlights was only, 'A couple of seconds.' The headlight beams veered
to the right by 30 to 45 degrees. The headlights had then momentarily
turned off. Following this they came back on and the beams, 'Bent,' 30
to 45 degrees to the right. The headlights then functioned normally.
Sullivan said it was difficult to describe this incident.

He did not stop the car to investigate but travelled approximately 40
miles (64 km) to his destination.

McDonald asked if the Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) had investigated,
Sullivan said, 'They had not.' McDonald asked if the Department of Civil
Aviation had investigated, he said, 'No, they had not.' Only the police,
UFO Investigation Center (UFOIC) and Victorian Flying Saucer Research
Society (VFSRS), and some university students had investigated this
sighting.

Ronald concluded that the headlights had been, 'Bent,' by magnetism or
gravity.

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Rodney Coutts, via
telephone, regarding his UFO sighting

Sighting Date: Not identified in the audio recording

Sighting Time: Not identified in the audio recording

Location of Sighting: Near 797 High Street, the suburb was not
identified.

Duration of Sighting: Less than five seconds

Witness(es): Rodney Coutts and his wife

Summary:

The interview was recorded with Rodney speaking to McDonald on the
telephone.

Apparently, the incident occurred in a residential street in Melbourne,
identified as opposite 797 High Street, the suburb was not identified.

Rodney Coutts and his wife were parked in their <i>MG</i> motor vehicle when
Rodney, 'Had the impression we were being watched.' Rodney was sitting
in the driver's seat and his wife was sitting, next to him, in the front
passenger's seat. McDonald asked if Rodney had experienced that feeling
previously, he replied that it was rather unusual for him to have that
feeling.

Rodney looked over his wife's shoulder, while they were both sitting in
the car. At that instant, he noticed a, 'Whiteish green ball of light,'
through the passenger side curtain window of the car. The ball of light
was two to three feet (approximately one metre) from the car, on the
passenger's side. Then his wife turned around and saw the same object.

The ball appeared to be a perfect sphere and was one to two feet (300 to
600 millimetres) in diameter. The sphere appeared to be hovering in the
same position and emitted no sound that could be heard. The sphere then
moved around the rear of the car and up to the driver's side of the car,
maintaining the same distance from the car. The sphere then moved to the
rear of the car, and, 'From there it shot straight up into the sky.' By
the time they got out of the car the sphere was nowhere to be seen.

The sighting lasted for about two to five seconds.

There appeared to be no change in colour of the light during the
sighting.

Rodney had not reported the sighting and inferred it had happened a few
years ago.

There were no other witnesses to the sighting.

McDonald asked Rodney what was his occupation and he replied that he was
worked for a Pharmaceutical company as a supervisor of the sales staff.

McDonald asked Rodney if he had any other UFO sightings, Rodney replied
that he had seen what looked like a luminous disc, moving low across the
sky, at least thirteen years ago.

Rodney Coutts is identified by McDonald as residing at East Brighton,
Victoria, Australia.

Interview Duration: (m:s): 20:04

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Kenneth Marshell

Sighting Date: 6 February 1955

Sighting Time: At night

Location of Sighting: On the South Gippsland Highway, East of Melbourne,
Victoria, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Not identified in the audio recording

Witness(es): Kenneth Marshell; his mother, his uncle and two aunts

Summary:

Marshell was not sure of the date, McDonald claimed the date was the 6
February 1955. They were travelling by car to home from a funeral, at a
speed of about 55mph (90 km/hr). There was no traffic, and they were on
a straight section of road. They noted a light in the sky which became
brighter, and Kenneth mentioned to his uncle, that whatever it was, it
had a, 'Decent set of lights on it.' He slowed the car down to let it
pass. However, the lights remained at about 200 to 300 yards (180 to 280
metres) behind them. It lit up their whole car.

They all looked at it. After about 30 seconds it split into two lights.

The main part went off to their right, across a paddock, parallel to the
ground. They watched it for a couple of hundred yards (180 metres), then
it accelerated. At this point they saw it as an, 'Illuminated railway
carriage with windows.'

The other part went to their left, but all of them watched the one to
the right. They continued driving down the road and knew that there were
no cross-roads. They were all puzzled by this event.

This event didn't frighten them, Kenneth reported the sighting to
Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society (VFSRS) in Melbourne,
Australia. They thought, at the time, that it was just a vehicle with
bright lights, until it split into two; one to the right and the other
to the left.

The original light in the sky looked like a wartime, 'Sperry light.'
These were four to five feet (one to two metres) in diameter. It had
clearly defined edges, and was white in colour. At a rough guess there
were, 'Six or seven windows.'

There was no effect to either the car or to any of the passengers.

Interview Duration (m:s): 29:22

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Dr Antoin Kukla and Audrey
Lawrence Sighting Date: 27 July 1965

Sighting Time: 5.30 pm

Location of Sighting: Near Carnarvon, Western Australia, Australia

Duration of Sighting: 30 minutes

Witness(es): Antoin Kukla and Audrey Lawrence

Summary:

Antoin Kukla was interviewed first.

The couple were driving towards Gascoyne Junction, Western Australia
with their Bull Terrier dog in the vehicle. Antoin saw a green light in
the sky which he thought was an aircraft. His fiancée didn't say
anything at first, then when the green light disappeared she asked if he
had seen, what she had seen? They continued driving and after two
minutes, suddenly, they saw an object. He braked the vehicle, and they
both got out.

Antoin estimated the object was a half to three quarters of a mile away
(one kilometre). After about ten minutes he went back to the car and got
out a monocular to view the object. It filled the field of view of the
monocular. He watched it for five minutes, then handed the monocular to
his fiancée. He was unable to estimate the size of the object, apart
from being big, perhaps bigger than a few feet (one metre). All this
time it oscillated in the sky. He thought it was approximately 80 feet
(24 metres) high.

The light appeared to be similar to a rugby football, being symmetrical
about its axes. When it was moving, its colour changed to red. When the
car was stopped, it was green in colour. Finally, after moving up and
down, and from side to side, it moved to the west. The next day they
visited the location where they saw the object and found nothing to
explain the sighting. They were terrified.

Antoin recounted another sighting made by men at the property of his
fiancée's brother. He claimed that the Bureau of Meteorology and the
Carnarvon tracking station had also observed this object.

Audrey Lawrence was then interviewed.

Audrey had told her brother the story of what happened to Antoin and
herself. Later, her brother said that some Aboriginal workers on his
station had seen a, 'Funny light,' come from the south-west, high in the
sky. There were two long tracks in the sky. It travelled across the sky
and had been visible for 30 minutes. Someone had telephoned the
Carnarvon tracking station and been told that they and the Bureau of
Meteorology had seen the light.

When it was overhead on her brother's property, it appeared to be going
straight up, towards the Moon, and then disappeared.

It was seen over a very wide area, from Carnarvon to North Hampton and
Port Headland. The sighting was not reported in the newspapers.
Television station <i>Channel 9</i> had got the whole story but it was all,
'Hushed up,' and presented at night around the end of 1966.

During their sighting the object initially looked like a green coloured
light and then it disappeared. It then appeared as an orange coloured
light. They stopped the car, and saw it in the north, travelling from
west to the east. The light grew in size from, 'Bread and butter plate
size, to three feet across (one metre).' Antoin said that he thought it
would crash. It dived at their car, and kept ahead of them. It circled
three times and came back to its original position. It hovered over the
road at times, 20 feet (six metres) high. When it was circling, she saw
a green glow, that illuminated the tree tops.

During the sighting Antoin's watch stopped for about 30 minutes. Their
dog was disturbed, and wouldn't get out of their car. There were no
effects on the car and no physiological effects noted by them.

Sighting Time: 2.21 pm

Location of Sighting: 1-3 Palm Grove, Deepdene, Melbourne, Victoria,
Australia

Duration of Sighting: Six seconds

Witness(es): James Johnson Kibel

Summary:

Kibel opens by stating that he had been in the garden to take pictures
of the flowers, and garden in general. There was a terrific flash of
light, 'Across here.' There was a thing, 'Up there,' it was behind the
chimney. He raised the camera, and took a photograph and hit his nose as
a result. He then dropped the camera to waist level. The trees in the
garden had been full of foliage.

He then went to see a workman, Mr D English, on the property. English
said he hadn't seen anything. Kibel took the photo out of the camera and
they both saw the image. Then there had been a loud bang which seemed to
come from the north-east. The willow tree, visible to McDonald had been
three times the size, in April 1966.

McDonald asked about the red reflection seen on the surface of the
object, in the photograph. Kibel said this reflection may be caused by
the two storey house belonging to a solicitor next door, or by another
house in the area that had a grey roof.

Then McDonald referred to a sketch which he had of the house and garden,
which also indicated the position of the object. Kibel stated that the
sketch had been drawn by himself and Peter Norris, and Kibel's mother.
Kibel stated that the object may have been much further away than the
position shown on the sketch. He pointed out to McDonald that English,
'Was here.' Kibel stated that the sketch had been done hurriedly about a
month after the incident. The chimney in the photograph was the one by
the garage.

McDonald asked Kibel, 'His estimate of the size of the object?' Kibel
replied, '15 to 20 feet diameter (five metres).' McDonald asked, 'The
height above the ground?' and Kibel responded, 'One hundred or so feet
(30 metres).' Kibel said that the duration of the event had been about 6
seconds, and that part of this time he was messing with the camera. They
checked the model of the camera and confirmed it to be a <i>Polaroid 800</i>.
The focal length of lens was not shown on camera. They again discussed
how could the red reflection on the image be a roof.

<i>Editor's note: This audio recording was made at Kibel's parents house,
in the garden, at the site of the visual and photographic sighting by
Kibel. See Part 1 of this sighting interview in the summaries.</i>

Australia

Duration of Sighting: 30 seconds

Witness(es): Roger Parry Jones and Christopher Parry Jones

Summary:

Roger, aged 11, was in his backyard. The Sun had set and it was
twilight. The sky was slightly hazy. He heard a sound and then saw an
unusual object in the sky. It was a light with an aura around it. It was
shaped like a hat, with a flat bottom. There were four to five portholes
in it, and a red light going around the object. The portholes were a
greyish or dirty yellow in colour. Roger sketched the object for
McDonald.

The lighted object was moving. The aura was red/yellow in colour. This
aura was a steady light, but shimmering in places. Roger was facing
west. The object was at a 30 to 40 degree elevation. It was first seen
due west, then it went behind a large pine tree, guessed to be half a
mile (800 metres) away.

Roger called out to his mother but she was busy and did not come out to
look. However, Roger's brother Christopher, aged 13, did come out but
did not see the object. No one else saw it. His mother rang up a radio
station and TV station, <i>Channel 2</i> who advised her to ring the
Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society (VFSRS). She did not contact
the Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) or the police.

There were no physiological effects to the two boys. Roger was very
excited after the sighting. Asked about the size of the object he
responded that, 'It was wider than the Moon.'

Location of Sighting: 30 km from Oslo, Norway

Duration of Sighting: 20 minutes

Witness(es): Mrs I Palmer, Captain L Witzke, Mr O Ortland and other
unidentified witnesses

Summary:

Two Norwegian families saw these lights. It wasn't talked about at the
time, as the Second World War was taking place.

Three cars were travelling down a mountain, in Oslo Fjord, 30 kilometres
from Oslo, Norway. The occupants of the cars saw a, 'Strange thing,' on
a clear night. It was a moving coloured light. It was initially seen as
a light, then as an object on the ground. The object was 18 metres in
diameter and on the ground. It looked like a big church bell, but
flatter. They actually saw the light settle on the ground.

It was first seen as a yellow/orange coloured glow, 500 metres away.
They saw it over the fjord, and coming towards them. They thought it was
an explosion and then it came closer. The engines of all three cars
stalled at a point where they saw the object on the ground. They later
thought, 'Magnetism,' may have caused the cars to stall.

They all got out of the cars and walked towards the object. The object
then departed straight upwards, before turning and travelling away
horizontally. The object may have been warm, because the snow had melted
in an 18 metre diameter circle where the object had landed.

Mrs Palmer said that she had heard of other sightings; the same type of
object seen in the north of Denmark, the tractors could not be started
(date unknown); another near Hanover, Germany in about 1948, 'A crop
circle,' was found and an object was seen in the cornfield.

<i>Editor's note: This is a telephone recording with a Mrs I Palmer, who
in 1967 was living at 8 Berwick Street, Brighton, Tasmania, regarding
the 1943 multi-witness sighting. The conversation, in terms of what
occurred, is very difficult to follow.</i>

Witness(es): Alan D Shaw and W L Newton; both electrical engineers for
the Tasmanian Hydroelectric Commission.

Summary:

The two men were inspecting a transmission structure near the
Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia.

Shaw read a typed statement to McDonald, that Shaw had prepared on the
day of the incident.

At 9.20 am Shaw drew Newton's attention to what appeared to be a piece
of newspaper in the air. The object may have been caught in an updraft,
over the zinc works, at an estimated height of 1000 feet (300 metres),
it floated down to about 200 feet (60 metres). It then accelerated to a
high speed and disappeared between two buildings, about a quarter of a
mile (400 metres) away. It was travelling at about 30 to 60 mph (110 to
220 kilometres per hour), and appeared to be, 'Flexible.' They later
searched the area and found nothing to account for this sighting.

Newton then saw a similar second object, and both men watched it until
it disappeared, behind the admin building, a few seconds after the first
object disappeared from view.

To the north-west, both men then saw a third, high flying, high speed
object, which travelled across the sky and disappeared behind Mount
Direction, that is 1469 feet (448 metres) high. This one was small, and
flashing a white light at 1500 cycles per minute. It appeared to be
several thousand feet (over 300 metres) high. In one second it travelled
through an angle of 20 degrees. A similar object was seen to the
north-east. At one time this object made large clockwise circular
motions in the sky. This object hovered, then moved towards the sun,
before being stationary.

After seeing these four objects, the men witnessed another two. The
latter two were jet black in colour and elongated, and observed to the
north of the sun. Mr Newton thought they had emerged from the fourth
object. They looked like inverted bowling skittles with the ball
leading. The men each watched one of these black objects to watch.
Shaw's one neared the Derwent River which at this point is 600 yards
(550 metres) wide. He thought his black object was three to six feet
(one to two metres) long and 300 yards (275 metres) away. When it got to
about 100 feet (30 metres) above the river it stopped, then moved
horizontally to the south for about 100 feet (30 metres). It descended
vertically and entered the water with no splash, at 1800 feet (550
metres) from Shaw. Two seagulls were passing by and they appeared to
momentarily stop and investigate the area where the object entered the
river. The time was 9.45 am.

The weather was sunny, with a light southerly breeze with sparse clouds.
Both men were wearing sunglasses during the observation.

Sighting Date: 8 January 1959

Sighting Time: 9 pm

Location of Sighting: Hobart Bay, Risdon, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia

Duration of Sighting: 15 minutes

Witness(es): Alan D Shaw and W L Newton

Summary:

Mr Shaw advised McDonald, that the previous year he had given a talk to
the local Astronomical Society about the events of 1959. Shaw had
prepared slides illustrating the event, which he and McDonald viewed as
they spoke.

Shaw said that both the weather bureau and the Royal Australian Airforce
(RAAF) had been informed of the observations but that no one had an
explanation for what was seen. A check for weather balloons found that
on this day none were released, apparently due to faulty equipment.

Shaw advised McDonald that on that day, a total of six objects had been
seen; two, 'Paper,' like; two flashing and two black.

When viewing the slides, McDonald clarified various points as Shaw read
from his statement (without the slides it is difficult to follow parts
of the conversation).

The objects that looked like newspaper appeared to be a 2:1 ratio in
size, and they were, 'Flexing,' as they moved. The second one, at times,
had a shape like a carrot or a turnip. These disappeared behind
buildings.

The black objects were near the sun. With sunglasses, and obscuring the
sun, the black objects were clearly outlined and visible. They had no
surface features. They were dull, jet black. When the object had entered
the water he had seen no obvious splash.

McDonald states that objects entering the water is of interest to him.

Shaw said that the resident RAAF officer commented to Shaw that he may
as well forget what he had seen.

Shaw gave a talk about the incident to members of the local Astronomical
Society, as he was a member of that group.

# James McDonald nterviews Elizabeth Wrobel 

Identification Code/CD Number: 3T19S1202/CD56

Date Recorded: 6 July 1967

File Size: 28.2 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 29:59

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Elizabeth Wrobel

Sighting Date: 14 April 1966

Sighting Time: 3.00 am

Location of Sighting: Strickland Avenue, Hobart West, Tasmania,
Australia

Duration of Sighting: 10 to 15 minutes

Witness(is): Elizabeth Wrobel

Summary:

Mrs Wrobel was driving her car when she saw something in the sky, over
trees in the distance. To the northwest there was a silent, bright glow,
which she initially thought may be a bush fire. However, on looking she
saw there were in fact four objects. They were shining a light
downwards. The objects were flat on the bottom, rounded on the top, and
well defined.

A pink light came downwards from the objects. She could clearly see the
objects against the sky. The objects themselves were not glowing. It was
a moonless night. This downwards light was very bright, in that it hurt
her eyes.

McDonald asked her to estimate the distance to the objects. Mrs Wrobel
thought that the trees would have been perhaps half a mile (800 metres)
away. Asked to estimate the size of each object she said 50 to 60 feet
(15 to 20 metres). She said the four objects were in a straight line and
nearly touching each other. She thought they were nearly touching the
trees. Asked about the duration of the sighting. She replied that she
did not have a watch with her as she was going to work, but she guessed
10 to 15 minutes.

The objects remained stationary, then the one second from her left, went
slowly upwards and then the lights from the entire four objects all
turned to a very pale green colour. This single object then came back
down slowly until it returned to its original position. She then took
her eyes off them and when she looked back she could not see any of the
objects.

After the sighting her eyes hurt and watered for at least a day. She
noticed no odours, had no headache, and said there were no other
witnesses present. She described the sighting to a woman at the
Elizabeth Street paper shop, since she had asked Mrs Wrobel what was
wrong with her when she first saw Mrs Wrobel that morning.

Another person, present at the interview, stated that at about the same
time, but not known if it was the same day, had contacted them to
mention something similar. A Mr Latham, at 1 am in the morning, in that
same area, heard a loud swishing sound. He went outside and saw nothing
to account for the noise. No aircraft fly over that area.

Another story was told, of a female neighbour of Mrs Wrobel, who heard
of Mrs Wrobel's sighting, said that she too had seen something similar
in that area, three times. This woman had told her parents about it, but
they were not interested.

A fire, on 7 February 1967 had burnt down the trees in the area where
the sighting had occurred.

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Peter F Noar

Sighting Date: Thought to be about 1955, but actually 27 September 1957

Sighting Time: Not identified in the audio recording

Location of Sighting: Hobart Airport, Tasmania, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Not identified in the audio recording

Witness(es): Gordon Carter was the radar operator at the time of the
incident

Summary:

Noar describes his recollections of a radar/visual event, which he
thought occurred in about 1955, although he is vague regarding the year.
He states that he cannot recall the time of day, or the type of weather
radar being used.

Initially, there was a visual sighting at the Launceston Airport.
Launceston contacted Hobart Airport and advised them of the visual
sighting, to see if Hobart could pick up the object on their radar.

The Hobart radar wasn't in service at the time so someone went to the
radar hut and warmed up the equipment. They picked up an object on the
radar. The Launceston tower advised that their object was heading south
from them towards Hobart, and wasn't concurrent with any normal aircraft
movement.

The Hobart weather observers painted their object travelling north. It
was seen to the north of Hobart at an estimated height of 9000 feet (275
metres), over Richmond, which is about six miles (9.7 kilometres) north
of Hobart Airport.

Noar stated he thought the radar was a type WF77 from the Navy. The
estimated speed based on the radar paint was 3000 mph (4800 kilometres
per hour). Asked by McDonald if the radar target was a, 'Hard,' target,

Noar replied, 'Yes.'

Noar said that Gordon Carter was the radar operator at the Hobart
Meteorological Bureau. There were no other visual observers other than
in Launceston. From what Noar could recall, the object was travelling
horizontally.

McDonald asked if the Tasmanian UFO Investigation Centre (TUFOIC)
members, who were present at the interview, could follow up and
interview Carter.

<i>Editor's note: This interview is about a weather radar/visual sighting,

Sighting Date: Various, between August 1965 and February 1966

Sighting Time: Various, mainly between 9.30 pm to 11.30 pm

Location of Sighting: Lighthouse on Maatsuyker Island, 16 kilometres off
SW corner of Tasmania, Australia Duration of Sighting: Varied

Witness(es): Three families living at the lighthouse.

Summary:

Thompson was working at the lighthouse between December 1965 and
February 1966. On one occasion a woman saw a light shining through the
bedroom window and looked out the window. She saw a light disappearing
behind clouds. This was in late December 1965. She estimated its angular
size as equal to that of the moon.

In August 1965, before Thompson arrived at the Island there was an
observation note in the lighthouse log that a white light had flashed
white and red. Someone had sent a completed questionnaire to the
Tasmanian UFO Information Centre (TUFOIC), in Hobart, Tasmania,
Australia. On that questionnaire, there was a statement, 'Fifteen feet
long.' McDonald asked if anyone knew what that meant, and those present,
indicated that they did not.

Most of the time the light was hovering, and at times it would suddenly
move position. McDonald asked Thompson to estimate its angular
displacement, he could not, then he said, 'It danced up and down.'
McDonald queried whether the observers knew about scintillation,
Thompson said that they did.

McDonald asked about patterns in the observations. Thompson said it was
there mainly between 9.30 pm and 11.30 pm. It would initially be
observed above the horizon and then gain elevation, but as it was seen
in the south west it moved counter to the Earth's rotation.

Thompson had only once viewed the light through binoculars, and on this
occasion it was a point source in size.

Sometimes it would be stationary for up to half an hour. Thompson could
not estimate its distance. McDonald thought it wasn't a helicopter,
aircraft, meteor or star.

It was always silent. At times the light cast a beam of light onto the
seawater. The lighthouse was some 400 feet (120 metres) above the sea
level.

Thompson later went to a nearby lighthouse, but did not see the mystery
light from that location. Although the matter was referred to the
Tasmanian Department of Shipping and Transport, there was no known
investigation.

Thompson mentioned one other observation that had not been recorded.
This observation occurred at night where a light was seen on the surface
of the sea, it passed between the Island and the mainland. This light
was observed for 30 minutes and he thought it may have been a Russian
trawler. Later he learnt that another observer had reported a light lift
off the seawater.

Browning

Sighting Date: Not identified in the audio recording, but known to be
the 4 October 1960

Sighting Time: Not identified in the audio recording

Location of Sighting: Cressy, Tasmania, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Not identified in the audio recording

Witness(es): Reverend Lionel Browning and his wife, Mrs L Browning

Summary:

Browning states that the mountain range to the east was, Ben Lomond.
There was a flat lake area and the Western Tiers were to their west. The
Sun was over the Tiers at the time. Heavy rain cleared a little 15
minutes before sunset. It was still raining to the east, the south and
the north.

He was looking out a window of a residence. His wife joined him there.
They were noting the rays of the Sun on the green grass. Mrs Browning
asked if he could see what she could see? This cigar shaped object
emerged from the storm. It was initially partly covered by rain below
the cloud base. Then it fully emerged. He thought it was a plane
crashing but noted that it was travelling below the stalling speed for
an aircraft. From memory he thought it came out about a mile and a half
(two to three kilometres). Its distance from him was estimated to be up
to three miles (five kilometres). He had a clear view of it. It was hard
to estimate its size, distance or speed.

At the time he had contacted the local aerodrome and ascertained that
there were no aircraft in the area. He had telephoned <i>The Age</i>
newspaper, in Melbourne, but they did not follow up the story, instead
the local paper published their sighting report. About a week later, he
was interviewed by an officer and two men from the Royal Australian
Airforce (RAAF).

Beside the cigar, that he termed, 'A mothership,' he saw a number of
smaller disc shaped objects. They had a flat underside which always
pointed towards the ground. There was a thickness to them.

He put his head out of a window in his house to get a better view. The,
'Mothership,' was stationary. Discs suddenly appeared at the southern
end. One came from the north and one from the east. They converged on
the, 'Mothership.' The two which came from north and east were
travelling fast and, 'Skipping like stones over water.' At times he
could see their undersides.

The group of discs and the two that converged came to the northern end
of the, 'Mothership.' They all started to go back into the rain storm.
One of the saucer's forward edge tipped. He lost sight of it as it was
pointing down at a 30 degree angle; the front end appeared to have
dipped.

Other sightings occurred in Tasmania around this time. He did not
investigate any of these sightings. The paper investigated reports.

Associated with the sightings there were unusual sounds. One was on the
night of their sighting, between 8 pm and 9 pm. He personally heard two
of these, 'Explosions.'

It sounded like a steel bar being struck, and was extremely loud. Cattle
and sheep were disturbed and dogs barked. A man at the end of town saw a
coloured object in the sky.

The RAAF investigated a sighting by a mother and daughter who saw a
hovering object near their home. They stopped their car to get a closer
look. The RAAF spent a day investigating this sighting.

<i>Editor's note: The sighting occurred on the 4 October 1960, and is
known, in published reports, as the Cressy, Tasmania sighting. The
conversation was recorded, by McDonald, in a car, on the way to the
airport.</i>

Sighting Time: 7.35 pm

Location of Sighting: Charleville, Queensland, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Eight to nine seconds

Witness(es): Warren S Jackson, and others

Summary:

This interview was recorded by McDonald in a car on the way to a radio
interview. The witness, Jackson was driving this car at the time of the
recording. Jackson's address at the time was Flat 2, 123 Belmont Road,
Mosman, New South Wales (NSW).

It was reported that a, 'Flying saucer,' had been observed by numerous
people located between central Queensland and central NSW.

Jackson had been working as a wool classer on a property. He was walking
to a restaurant when it was getting dark. He looked up to see a long
object, with, 'A searchlight,' illuminating from the front, and, 'A
forked light,' illuminating from the rear. Each of the fork lights on
the rear appeared to be, 'A searchlight.' The object made a noise like,
'A jet engine,' and similar to a, 'Hissing sound.'

The height and distance to the object was difficult to estimate. There
was no shape apparent behind the lights. It travelled across the sky in
a straight line, with a uniform motion. There were no physiological
effects. He realized it was not a plane.

Sighting Date: 1 January 1966

Sighting Time: 2 am

Location of Sighting: 11 to-13 kilometres north of Wee Waa, New South
Wales, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Five minutes

Witness(es): Mrs Gael Penrose and Guy Norman (age 12)

Summary:

Mrs Penrose, from Lindhurst, Boggabri, New South Wales (NSW), was
driving a car, with Guy Norman in the passenger's seat. They were
driving along an isolated, unsealed road when they observed lights in
the sky that appeared to be moving downwards. Mrs Penrose thought that
the lights were an aircraft about to land. There were no airports in the
immediate area. The lights were white in colour, and appeared to be
descending, as if, about to crash. Then the lights levelled off and
moved upwards at a steep angle. They repeated this sequence three to
four times, before disappearing.

After five minutes, and while Mrs Penrose was still driving, she saw
lights in her rear vision mirror. She thought at first it was the
headlights of a car behind them. These lights quickly approached their
vehicle and appeared to pass over the roof of their vehicle, after
momentarily hovering above the roof. The lights then were seen in front
of their vehicle, and then travelling away to be lost from view. After
seeing the lights, initially in the rear vision mirror, Guy leaned out
of the car through the open window. He confirmed the lights were not
from another vehicle, and that they were the same lights they had seen
five minutes earlier.

McDonald asked Mrs Penrose if she could estimate the distance above the
car roof. She thought it was hundreds of feet (100 metres), but Guy had
thought it was on top of the vehicle. There was no sound associated with
the lights at any stage of the observation.

It was a very dark night, and the white light from the lights faintly
illuminated the area. There were three to four white lights with no
apparent shape.

She mentioned the sighting to her brother who was on Collymongle
Station, NSW. He said that one of the men on the station said he had
seen two or three similar things and that, 'They go over the house.'
This station is 20 kilometres from the road.

Mrs Penrose has not seen anything like this since this incident.

Interview Details: James E McDonald interviews Mrs J Naughton, her
daughter Serena, and son Kenneth Sighting Date: Late February 1962

Sighting Time: 'A little before dusk.'

Location of Sighting: Port Moresby, The Territory of Papua and New
Guinea

Duration of Sighting: Several minutes

Witness(es): Mrs J Naughton; Mr Kenneth Naughton; their daughter,
Serena, and son, Kenneth

Summary:

At the time of this interview, the Naughtons' were living at, 15
Grandview Street, Pymble, Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The
interview was conducted by telephone, with breaks when Mrs Naughton
consulted with her husband over various aspects of the sighting.

The date of the sighting was first believed to be February/March 1962,
then Mrs Naughton decided it was late February 1962. The family were
living in the Ela Beach area of Port Moresby, the capital city of The
Territory. They lived in a house on a cliff overlooking the bay. She was
standing on the front balcony of the house, facing the water. Her
husband was inside and only saw the end of the sighting.

At the time of the sightings her son, Kenneth, was age ten, and
daughter, Serena, age seven. They were both nearby at the time of the
sighting.

Mrs Naughton, saw a rowing boat, stationary in the water below the
house, with two, 'Men,' sitting in the boat. She watched this boat for
five minutes. Then she looked at the top of a nearby mountain, where
there was a red anti-aircraft collision beacon. She saw, 'This thing,'
come around the mountain. It was round and appeared to be a grey/steel
colour. It travelled over the bay in front of her, then turned to the
left of her; turned again and hovered over the rowing boat. It stayed
there for, 'A couple of minutes,' then departed. Her son was jumping up
and down. Her daughter called Mr Naughton to come and look at it.

While the object had been over the boat, 'Signalling,' began. A white
light came down from the object and shone on the boat. A fainter light
shone from the boat towards the object. The light on the object flashed
on and off. The light from the boat, shone upwards, like a torch. She
thought the signalling appeared, 'Contrived.'

The object had a red light around its rim. Asked about its shape, she
replied, 'That it was like a dinner plate.' It was saucer like, flat on
the bottom and rounded on the top. She thought there was a little dome
on the top, but said her son and daughter didn't see this. Around the
rim of the base were a series of individual red lights. She had the
impression this was due to red light shining out of portholes in the
object. These red lights were not rotating or blinking. The signalling
white light came from the right-hand side rim, near the bottom. The
shape of the object was symmetrical around its central axis. It was
distinct in outline and therefore, not blurred.

After further questioning, by McDonald, she stated that she had not seen
the underneath of the object as it had hovered level with their cliff
top house. She estimated the house was 30 metres above the water.

The light flashing from the object seemed to be in a pattern, of 1-2-3-4
down, and then a light from the boat below signalled the same sequence.
There were then other sequences of flashing lights passing between
object and the boat. She was unable to estimate the duration of this
signalling.

The figures in the boat were sitting down. The, 'Man,' in the front was
doing the signalling to the object, using a torch.

At this point Mrs Naughton made a reference to another sighting, by a
man named Allan Davis. The day after the Naughtons' sighting, she heard
from Mr Davis, a neighbour of theirs who had a nearby flat, that in
1957, over the same bay, Davis sighted a, 'Flying saucer.' He said that
at 2 am one morning, in bright moonlight, he had seen an unusual object,
signalling. Davis worked for the Australian Department of Civil
Aviation.

McDonald asked Mrs Naughton if in 1962, there had been talk of
Indonesian espionage in the area? She said there had not.

McDonald mentioned the 1959 Reverend William Gill sighting, and Mrs
Naughton stated that she had read about it in the papers, and that she
was aware that Gill had an excellent reputation. She had never met him.

McDonald asked what Mrs Naughton thought the family had seen that
evening in 1962? She said she thought it was a, 'Scout ship,' that had
been around since biblical times and watching our development; perhaps
later to contact us when we had space travel. She had come to this
conclusion since 1962.

McDonald then spoke to Serena, then aged 12. Serena's account was that
there had been a, 'Flying saucer,' near the house, and a boat in the
water, they were signalling to each other. The object had been white,
with five to six lights around its rim. It looked like two saucers stuck
together. She did not see the dome her mother thought she had seen. The
object finally turned around and quickly moved away.

McDonald spoke to Kenneth, then aged 15 years. Kenneth said he saw the
object come around the hill into the bay from his right. It was long and
slender in shape. It was a shiny colour, silver and not very shiny. It
had lights around its rim, which appeared to be reddish. He saw an
exchange of light flashes between object and boat. The object finally
left, after hovering. It went upwards and was lost from view, very
quickly.

McDonald returned to speaking with Mrs Naughton and asked her about the
relative diameter of the object. After much discussion she settled on a
diameter of half a metre at three metres distance. She said that at no
time was there any noise associated with the object and there had been
no flames during its departure. She had seen nothing like it since.

<i>Editor's note: Prior to 1945, Papua and New Guinea were separate areas.
In 1945 Papua and New Guinea were combined in an administrative union.
In 1949, The Territory of Papua and New Guinea, was declared and
administered by Australia. In 1972, the name was changed to Papua New
Guinea.</i>

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Colin C Trims

Sighting Date: 9 March 1966

Sighting Time: Between 2.30 am and 2.45 am

Location of Sighting: Between Caboolture and Bribie Island, Queensland,
Australia

Duration of Sighting: Two to three minutes

Witness(es): Colin C Trims

Summary:

Trims, aged 42 at the time, was a milkman on a delivery. He was driving
along when he saw a, 'Fire,' in the distance. It was stationary and he
was approaching it. He drove parallel with it for 200 to 360 metres. The
light was a round, dark red ball with a white halo.

He estimated its size as nine metres diameter, and it was round, like a
ball. It was over swampy ground which had been cleared. It seemed to be
within a few feet (one metre) of the ground. There was no glow on the
ground, and no apparent sparks, or flames. There was no noise associated
with the ball of light, and it remained motionless. Then after a while
it rose from the ground, slowly at first.

The sky was very clear and there was no wind. Stars were visible. He
watched it for two to three minutes before it rose. He stopped his truck
and walked across the road to a fence and stopped. Asked if he had
noticed any unusual effects he replied that he had a clammy-sweating
feeling. Another effect that he had noticed was that the radio in his
vehicle went off about a mile before he got to the light. It didn't work
again until about four hours later. There had been no effect on the
vehicle's engine.

The object had risen into the sky as he watched from the fence. It rose
like a balloon, with no change of colour or shape. It took about 60
seconds before it was out of view.

There were no other witnesses to the event, but he had spoken to a Mr
Doo who had seen a fiery object some two weeks before Trims' sighting.
Trims had never seen anything like this before or since. He thought it
may have been 360 metres away, over the swampy land that had been
cleared of trees.

Trims' wife had reported this sighting to the newspaper. The Royal
Australian Airforce (RAAF) had not been advised. He had been interviewed
by a UFO group.

McDonald states that the 12 March 1966 <i>Courier Mail</i> newspaper

Sighting Time: 7.30 am

Location of Sighting: 12 kilometres south of Rockhampton, Queensland,
Australia

Duration of Sighting: Several minutes

Witness(es): Mrs Daphne Ringland and Mrs Gloria Jones

Summary:

McDonald discusses a newspaper article from the <i>Courier Mail</i> that is
about a sighting that occurred at 7.30 pm on the 22 July 1965, 12
kilometres south of Rockhampton.

The article states that Mrs Ringland was travelling as a passenger in a
car driver by Mrs Jones. Mrs Jones was a, 'Star-gazer.' They were
travelling towards Gladstone when Mrs Jones saw a bright light in the
sky. Mrs Ringland suggested it was the planet Venus but Mrs Jones said
it was too bright. Mrs Jones stopped the car, and they both saw a
triangle of lights in the sky, evenly spaced. The one on the right-hand
side was bigger and slightly smaller than the Moon with an irregular
shape.

Then the two bottom lights began to descend, slowly at first. The one on
the right occasionally, 'Lurched,' towards the right. They descended
slowly towards the ground. The one on the left disappeared behind a
nearby hill. The other one continued to approach them, and emitted,
green/red/yellow coloured lights. The sky was dark since they were in
the countryside. This light followed the contours of the ground. It
appeared to be 180 metres directly ahead of their vehicle. It gave a,
'Jolt,' as it landed on the ground. There was no sound heard from the
light. The lights appeared to be in two parts, with the top part
rotating. The lights on top were a blur of green/red/yellow colours.

There was no defined shape to the light. Mrs Jones who had an interest
in UFOs and suggested they go closer. Mrs Jones was always talking about
flying saucers. They drove round to a side road in an effort to get
closer to the light. After travelling one and a half kilometres from
their previous position, they spotted a light among the trees glowing
green/red and yellow. Mrs Jones wanted to get even closer, so they
stopped the car and went across the other side of the bitumen road. Mrs
Jones then said she heard a noise and reentered the car. They continued
to watch it from inside the car. They had at this point switched off the
car's engine and headlights. An orange glow was seen and two red lights,
like car tail lights.

Date Recorded: 9 July 1967

File Size: 12.7 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 13:34

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Gordon L Jameson

Sighting Date: Late 1952

Sighting Time: About 11 pm

Location of Sighting: Slacks Creek, Queensland, Australia

Duration of Sighting: 30 seconds

Witness(es): Gordon L Jameson

Summary:

On a Sunday morning, Jameson sighted three objects with a metallic
surface appearance, in the sky. They were traveling parallel to the
Pacific Highway, and travelling south. He thought that they may have
been at least a 100 metres high. He could hear sound from the objects,
which were doing figures of eight in the sky; in and out of each other.
The sound was like an object cutting through the air, that made, 'A
whooshing noise.' It was very loud. The figure of eight was in the
horizontal plane.

They were traveling faster than a small, light aircraft, which he
occasionally saw from the nearby training base. The objects were smaller
than such aircraft. The objects were oblong. Asked about their size,
Jameson responded that they were larger than a bird but smaller than a
light plane.

Asked about their colour he replied that the colour was similar to that
of aluminium. They were quite bright, and reflecting the sun as opposed
to glowing of their own accord. They were smooth in appearance, and
showed no structure.

When queried again about their movement, he said they were not in fact
following a figure of eight path across the sky, but traveling across
the sky, and weaving in and out of each other's path; wheeling like
birds, as they travelled across the sky.

He estimated the total duration of his observation as about 30 seconds.

He had first seen the objects overhead, after initially hearing the
sound and looking up, then watched them travel across the sky towards
the horizon.

McDonald asked him if there had been any other witnesses, and Jameson
said that there were none, but that a neighbour, Mr Russell, said he had
also heard the same sound. Jameson at the time of the sighting, had
called out for his wife to have a look, but she was unable to see the
objects.

He rang the Amberley, Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) base and
discussed the sighting with them. The RAAF had asked if he had advised
the newspapers of the sighting? He said he had not. The RAAF said they
would prefer that he did not contact the papers.

McDonald then returned to the question of the objects' shape. Did they
have sharp edges or were they diffused? Jameson was unable to clarify
this question.

Jameson advised that there had been a sighting of three objects at
Dalby, Queensland, about 240 kilometres from Slacks Creek, Queensland on
the same day. This sighting had been reported in the newspaper the
following day.

# nterviews Vincent Doo 

Identification Code/CD Number: 3T22S203/CD59

Date Recorded: 9 July 1967

File Size: 12.4 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 12:55

Interview Details: James McDonald interviews Vincent Doo of Brisbane

Sighting Date: Beginning of February 1966

Sighting Time: Between 8.30 pm to 9.0 pm

Location of Sighting: Toorbul Point, Queensland, Australia

Duration of Sighting: Minutes

Witness(es): Vincent Austin Doo

Summary:

At time of this interview, Vincent Austin Doo was living at, 111 Arthur
Street, New Farm, Queensland. He had been living at <i>The Kiosk</i>, located
at Toorbul Point, when the sighting occurred. Doo could not recall the
date of the sighting, when prompted by McDonald. McDonald said that the
date was at the beginning of February 1966, at between 8.30 pm and 9 pm.

Doo states that it was a lovely, clear night. There was moonlight,
around the time of the full Moon. His television, 'Went out,' and he,
'Couldn't see nothing.' He was inside <i>The Kiosk</i> and couldn't receive
any stations on his television. He got a ladder and went outside to look
at his TV antenna.

Looking north, about 140 to 200 metres away, he saw an object apparently
hovering over the mangroves. It then advanced towards him, at about 15
to 20 metre elevation. It came towards him until it was an estimated 75
metres away. Two dogs were heard barking. Then the object remained
stationary and then went up and shot away, it made a noise like a vacuum
cleaner. The object went back the way it had come, until it was obscured
from view behind the trees.

There was a swamp near <i>The Kiosk</i>. When the object came down, he
couldn't see it from where he was located. It was not visible in the six
metres high mangroves. Doo said that on previous occasions he had found
burn marks in the mangroves, he said, 'It burns the trees where it
lands.' Some trees were burned and he had not seen any fires in this
swamp. He had seen other burned areas in the swamp, perhaps in three or
four locations.

McDonald asked if there were any burn marks associated with this
sighting? Doo responded that he didn't see any that he could associate
with the object seen at the beginning of February 1966.

Doo said that he had tried to get his wife to take a look but she
wouldn't get out of bed. His son had not been at home that night. Asked
about the size of the object by McDonald, Doo estimated it was four and
a half to five metres in length and oval. Doo described the object as
being lit up around its side with a glowing that projected downwards
towards the trees. Its top was described as being, 'Real dark,' and that
the bottom or base, had been lit up. There were no portholes in the
object. Its closest distance to him was 25 metres (although earlier he
said 75 metres). Doo also stated that, 'It would have landed but the
dogs barked at it.'

After the object left, the TV, which was only two weeks old, started
operating normally. Doo stated that, his previous TV, 'Played up a lot.'

McDonald asked about the colour of the glow from the object and Doo
replied, 'It was white.' He stated that when the object was going away,
the glow was a pink to cherry red colour. It left travelling north-west.
Asked if he had a camera, he said he didn't. A report on the incident
had been submitted to the Brisbane UFO group.

# James McDonald Interviews Les Benedek 

Identification Code/CD Number: 3T22S205/CD59

Date Recorded: June/July 1967

File Size: 9.4 MB

Interview Duration (m:s): 9:47

Interview Details: James E McDonald interviews Les Benedek

Sighting Date: 24 January 1966

Sighting Time: 10.30 pm

Location of Sighting: Perth, Western Australia, Australia

Duration of Sighting: 15 seconds

Witness(es): Mr Les Benedek

Summary:

On 24 January 1966 at about 10.30 pm, a Mr Benedek was in Perth, Western
Australia. He said he was taking colour photographs when he saw a
bluish-green light, he described the object as, 'It was oval shaped with
an antenna on the front and dropped towards the river at terrific
speed.'

Various details on this sighting have been published:

1.  <i>Australian Flying Saucer Review</i>, Number 5, Victoria Edition, July
    1966, p 20

2.  <i>Australian Flying Saucer Review</i>, Number 9, UFO Investigation
    Centre (UFOIC) Edition (image inside front cover)

3.  <i>Sun Herald</i> newspaper, Sydney, 5 July 1966

4.  <i>Perth Sunday Times</i> newspaper, 5 June 1966

5.  <i>Life International</i> magazine, 18 April 1966

Benedek says that he moved back with the camera, and placed the camera
on a rock. McDonald states that the second and third photographs were
taken from a slightly different place, as indicated by the position of
the brush in front. McDonald mentions someone called Martin, who was
bothered about the first of the three photographs, in that the alignment
of the distant lights suggests quite a substantial displacement from the
other two photographs. The photograph in questions was the one showing a
small dot. Benedek responds by saying that the first photograph referred
to by McDonald may not in fact be the first one that he had taken.
Benedek claims he used a complete roll of film.

Benedek was at Kings Park, Perth, taking photographs. Then he went
towards the bay where there is a park. There he said he sighted the,
'Flying saucer,' and he was able to take three photographs of the object
while standing at the same location. McDonald suggested that the first
photograph was taken 400 to 800 metres from the other two photographs.
Benedek wondered if he had mixed up the photographs.

McDonald said the pictures appeared in an UFOIC magazine cover with an
arrow pointing to a dot. McDonald then discussed Martin's second point
of concern. This was that photograph two, the one with the flare-like
object at a higher angular elevation than photograph three, shows the
streaks on a distance highway broken into three parts. A correspondent
of Martin's had surveyed the site, this indicated that the small breaks
in the photograph were caused by trees.

This finding appeared to confirm that there were only three cars.
McDonald then states that based on this finding his estimate of the
negatives' exposure time was 15 seconds.

Ripples on the streaks had been measured and corresponded with a
breathing rate. He was puzzled about the tripod mounting and how the
sinusoidal ripples had occurred.

Benedek claims that he had the camera on a tripod. He kept his finger on
the button to keep the camera shutter open, allowing him to take a time
exposure. The ripples in the photograph could have been due to his hand
shaking. McDonald claims that Martin thought it was on a cable release.
Benedek claimed that he had set the camera to, 'B,' and therefore not
used a cable shutter release.

McDonald then asks, 'What about the estimate of 15 seconds?' Benedek is
uncertain, stating, 'I thought it was less than 15 seconds, perhaps 10
seconds.' Benedek claims the object was hovering at first then moved
downwards. Martin's correspondent had duplicated the scene using a 15
second exposure.

McDonald asked, 'How long it had been between when the photographs were
taken and developed?' Benedek answered, 'It was a week.' McDonald then
asks, 'What did you do then?' Benedek replies, " 'I took them to the
Sydney Morning Herald', they said, 'We will reproduce them as black and
white, why not take them to Life International?' " Benedek claims a Mr
Shirley from Life International told him to submit the photographs to
the Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF). He did this, and an officer from
the RAAF told him,

'Certainly not reflections.'

Life International published the photographs in the, 18 April 1966
edition.

<i>Editor's note: It is claimed that the Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF)
examined the photographs but nothing about this sighting has been found
on RAAF files that are in the National Archives of Australia.</i>

<i>The correct spelling of Les Benedek's surname has been confirmed in
various publications by Keith Basterfield ^\[1\]^. The file name of the
original audio file supplied by the University uses the name Les
Berdick.</i>
